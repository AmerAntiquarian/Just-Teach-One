        <p> EXPLORING the paths of <lb/>nature, and tracing her thro' <lb/>her numerous meanders, is
          certainly <lb/>an occupation suited to intellectual <lb/>beings, who cannot more
          gratefully <lb/>acknowledge the blessing than by <lb/>employing their faculties in con-
            <lb break="no"/>templating the power and good- <lb break="no"/>ness of the Divine Giver,
          as ex- <lb break="no"/>hibited in his works; nor has he <lb/>only adapted, in a
          considerable de- <lb break="no"/>gree, the mind of man to the task, <lb/>but has likewise
          added a stimulus, <lb/>by making many of our worldly en- <lb break="no"/>joyments depend
          on an acquaintance <lb/>with her; but were all other ad- <lb break="no"/>vantages wanting,
          there is one <lb/>which would render the favour in- <lb break="no"/>valuable. Abstracted
          from the doc- <lb break="no"/>trine of revelation, which is as yet <lb/>but partially
          believed by the world, <lb/>the book of nature is the only re- <lb break="no"/>cord from
          which the existence, <lb/>power, &amp;c. of the Great Former <lb/>and Governor of the
          universe can <lb/>be deduced: contemplating the <lb/>endless pages of this book, not only
          <lb/>ultimately raises our ideas to the <cb/>
          <lb/>Deity, but likewise has this supe- <lb break="no"/>riority over all earthly
          enjoyments, <lb/>that it never cloys; being, to us, <lb/>boundless, and affording infinite
          <lb/>variety. </p>
        <p> The portion of the globe we in- <lb break="no"/>habit, which was a few centuries
          <lb/>since, in a manner a new creation <lb/>to the eastern world, will doubtless
          <lb/>supply naturalists with variety of <lb/>curious and interesting objects, and
          <lb/>afford an ample field for specula- <lb break="no"/>tion and experiments, though lit-
            <lb break="no"/>tle thereof has yet appeared; ow- <lb break="no"/>ing, I apprehend, to
          the following <lb/>causes.—Not much more than the <lb/>eastern border of the country has
          <lb/>yet been inhabited by a civilized <lb/>people; a border, probably, con- <lb
            break="no"/>sisting in great part, of new lands, <lb/>formed by alterations, in which
          few <lb/>of the fossil productions of nature <lb/>can be expected; nor have the <lb/>other
          parts had fair play for exhibit- <lb break="no"/>ing their curiosities, as little more
          <lb/>than the surface has been examined, <lb/>and that by persons attentive only <lb/>to
          present subsistence, and future <pb/>
          <lb/>provision for themselves and fami- <lb break="no"/>lies, who, if chance laid any
          thing <lb/>not conducive thereto, in their way, <lb/>though ever so deserving of philo-
            <lb break="no"/>sophic attention, passed it by unno- <lb break="no"/>ticed, as not
          affording any assist- <lb break="no"/>ance to the principal objects; but <lb/>the case
          has, for several years past, <lb/>been beneficially altering, as easier <lb/>circumstances
          have enabled some <lb/>to make considerable advances to- <lb break="no"/>wards inviting
          science to take up <lb/>her residence among us. Nor can <lb/>we doubt her compliance, if
          not <lb/>wanting to ourselves; the means <lb/>of acquiring knowledge daily im- <lb
            break="no"/>proving, as well by the increase of <lb/>people, which obliges many to re-
            <lb break="no"/>sort to the countries from whence <lb/>numerous subjects of admiration
          <lb/>and contemplation may be expect- <lb break="no"/>ed, as by an increase of wealth
          <lb/>flowing from an extensive com- <lb break="no"/>merce, which affords not only
          <lb/>means of promoting liberal educa- <lb break="no"/>tion, and of applying the abilities
          <lb/>thereby acquired to the cultivation <lb/>of science, but will likewise en- <lb
            break="no"/>courage and enable those favourites <lb/>of nature, whom she has endowed
          <lb/>with mental faculties sufficient to <lb/>become their own instructors, and
          <lb/>dispense with the assistance of pre- <lb break="no"/>ceptors to a more intense
          application. </p>
        <p> Certainly the principal objects of <lb/>our several literary societies for dif- <lb
            break="no"/>fusing knowledge, are to foster and <lb/>nourish the tender plants of
          science <lb/>and natural knowledge in <placeName>America</placeName>, <lb/>the fulfilling
          of which must not only <lb/>promote the welfare of our country, <lb/>but also redound to
          the honour of <lb/>those who generously give their at- <lb break="no"/>tention thereto. I
          have often en- <lb break="no"/>joyed, by anticipation, the plea- <lb break="no"/>sure of
          contemplating the benefits <lb/>that may be derived from their at- <lb break="no"/>tention
          and labours; but a recent <lb/>instance of inattention makes me <cb/>
          <lb/>apprehensive, the full completion <lb/>thereof is more distant than I ex- <lb
            break="no"/>pected, and has given me room to <lb/>think that military and political
          <lb/>considerations have not yet quitted <lb/>that place in our minds necessity
          <lb/>lately obliged them to occupy; but <lb/>the cause being at an end, I hope <lb/>the
          consequences will soon <seg xml:id="a001" corresp="#n001">subside.</seg><note
            xml:id="n001" corresp="#a001">The reference is to the end of the War of
            Independence.</note>
        </p>
        <p> Though from causes already men- <lb break="no"/>tioned, <placeName>America</placeName>
          has not yet fully <lb/>opened her treasure of natural cu- <lb break="no"/>riosities,
          neither has she been en- <lb break="no"/>tirely deficient; and the <placeName>banks of 
            <lb/>the Ohio</placeName> have exhibited specimens <lb/>of petrifactions,
          that have been <lb/>thought worthy a place in some of <lb/>the most famous museums in
            <placeName>Eu- <lb break="no"/>rope</placeName>, and occasioned a diversity of
          <lb/>sentiments among philosophers; for <lb/>though universal consent allows their
          <lb/>origin to the animal kingdom, yet <lb/>it is a controverted point to what
          <lb/>species thereof; many circumstances <lb/>have given room to deduce them <lb/>from
          elephants, and other cogent <lb/>arguments to support the contrary <lb/>opinion.
            <persName>Dr. Hunter</persName> has em- <lb break="no"/>braced the latter and
          countenanced <lb/>it by evidences exhibited in the fifth <lb/>number of the 58th vol. of 
          the <bibl>Phi- <lb break="no"/>losophical Transactions</bibl>: if certain- <lb break="no"/>ty can ever
          be obtained in this case, <lb/>I apprehend it can be had only from <lb/>a critical
          examination of various <lb/>specimens, and these of different <lb/>parts. An opportunity
          of assisting <lb/>in this has lately <supplied>been</supplied> offered by an of- <lb
            break="no"/>ficer returned last summer from the <lb/>western frontiers of this state,
          bring- <lb break="no"/>ing a thigh bone, part of a jaw, <lb/>with the grinders, and part
          of a <lb/>tusk, all which have been, for se- <lb break="no"/>veral months, exposed to
          public <lb/>view in the library of this city, <lb/>which opportunity I expected would
          <lb/>have been embraced by some well <lb/>qualified person to have favoured <lb/>the world
          with a description of, and <pb/>
          <lb/> remarks on them; and I hoped <lb/>such a piece would have been pro- <lb break="no"
          />duced by some person better quali- <lb break="no"/>fied; but am hitherto disappointed,
          <lb/>and the removal of them into ano- <lb break="no"/>ther, and less public room, making
          <lb/>me apprehensive they would be for- <lb break="no"/>gotten or neglected, I have under-
            <lb break="no"/>taken the task, though sorry it has <lb/>fallen to my lot, as nothing
          more <lb/>than a simple description can be ex- <lb break="no"/>pected, which might have
          been <lb/>rendered more valuable by observa- <lb break="no"/>tions suggested by superior
          know- <lb break="no"/>ledge. Convinced that the eye can <lb/>considerably assist the
          understanding, <lb/>and remove doubts that may arise <lb/>from words and typographical er-
            <lb break="no"/>rors in figures, I requested <persName>Colonel <lb/>De Brahm</persName>,
          to favour me with a <lb/>drawing of them; and to render it <lb/>as serviceable as
          possible, to do it <lb/>from accurate measures, with which <lb/>request he very readily
          and oblig- <lb break="no"/>ingly complied, and has laid them <lb/>down by a scale of two
          inches to <lb/>a foot, so that the representations <lb/>are one-sixth of the size of the
          <lb/>boriginals. </p>
        <p> The length of the thigh bone <lb/>from (a) to (b), <seg xml:id="a002" corresp="#n002"
            >Fig. I.</seg><note xml:id="n002" corresp="#a002">See Plate prefixed. [Note in
            original.]</note> is 3 feet <lb/>8 ½ inches, breadth at (c d) 11 <lb/>inches, at (e f)
          one foot, and at (i k) <lb/>7 ½ inches, but the diameter at right <lb/>angles with this,
          but 4 inches; the <lb/>side that appears here is much com- <lb break="no"/>pressed, the
          other more prominent, <lb/>the diameter of the head (g h) 7 <lb/>inches, and its
          circumference 20 ⅛, <lb/>the neck that unites it to the fe- <lb break="no"/>mur is short
          and much of the same <lb/>thickness as the head; the trans- <lb break="no"/>verse diameter
          of the condyle (l) 5 <lb/>inches, and longitudinal 5 ¾, those <lb/>of the condyle (m) 4 ⅛
          and 4 ⅝, the <lb/>weight of the whole 79 pounds; <lb/>colour, a jet black, except in some
          <lb/>places where the surface is da- <lb break="no"/>maged, which appear of a cinerous <cb/>
          <lb/>or light earth colour, with nu- <lb break="no"/>merous small black spots. </p>
        <p> Fig. II. Part of a tusk, length <lb/>2 feet 11 inches, greatest diameter <lb/>3 ¾
          inches. The tooth, of which this <lb/>is a part, was probably not much <lb/>larger, as may
          be conjectured from <lb/>the diameter of its thickest part, <lb/>otherwise the whole must
          have been <lb/>of an unusual length. The specimen <lb/>under examination, has been much
          <lb/>injured, but, I imagine, will be <lb/>thought more valuable to a natu- <lb break="no"
          />ralist than in its perfect state, as its <lb/>internal parts are thereby conspicu- <lb
            break="no"/>ous, and its texture obvious. The <lb/>whole consists of a number of coni-
            <lb break="no"/>cal cups, a little curved and insert- <lb break="no"/>ed one into
          another, the internal <lb/>ones 1, 2, 3, and 4, are very distin- <lb break="no"/>guishable
          from each other and from <lb/>those which form the outward case, <lb/>which is likewise
          composed of a se- <lb break="no"/>ries of cups to be distinguished by <lb/>separations in
          a few places that ap- <lb break="no"/>pear like regular longitudinal cracks; <lb/>the
          traverse crack (cd) renders the <lb/>upper part separable from the lower, <lb/>and exposes
          to view six inches of a <lb/>cup inserted in the upper but ad- <lb break="no"/>hering to
          the lower part, by its co- <lb break="no"/>nical figure; the surface of the outer
          <lb/>case appears fluted, the channels <lb/>about half an inch broad, but not <lb/>a line
          deep, and appear as if again <lb/>fluted by a number of minute chan- <lb break="no"/>nels
          barely perceptible; in some <lb/>places the enamel, well polished, <lb/>still remains. At
          first view, I con- <lb break="no"/>ceived this extraordinary texture, <lb/>so different
          from the apparent one <lb/>of ivory, was an additional argument <lb/>in favour of
            <persName>Dr. Hunter’s</persName> opinion; <lb/>to remove all doubts as far as possi-
            <lb break="no"/>ble, I went to an <seg xml:id="a003" corresp="#n003">ivory

              turner</term>: a professional craftsman working with ivory.</note>
          <lb/>and, with a glass that magnified con- <lb break="no"/>siderably, examined several
          pieces <lb/>of ivory, cut transversely, but could <lb/>not perceive the least trace of
          sepa- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ration, such as might be expected <lb/>from cups inserted one within ano-
            <lb break="no"/>ther, till I saw some pieces thrown <lb/>aside as useless, in which
          circular <lb/>cracks, running regularly
            <choice><sic>parrallel</sic><corr>parallel</corr></choice>
          <lb/>to the circumference, appeared to <lb/>the naked eye: these separations, <lb/>the
          turner told me, were owing to <lb/>the teeth having lain long soaking <lb/>in water and
          exposed to the wea- <lb break="no"/>ther, which certainly must have <lb/>been the case
          with the fossil tusk; <lb/>consequently the matter appeared <lb/>as dubious as before. </p>
        <p> Fig. III. A grinder, separated <lb/>from the jaw, in which I did not <lb/>perceive any
          thing remarkable; ex- <lb break="no"/>cept the covering of that part which <lb/>was out of

          from its grain. But <lb/><persName>Col. de Brahm</persName>, and others, were <lb/>of
          opinion, it was only the ivory <lb/>petrified; which is likely, as none <lb/>of it spread
          over the fangs, which <lb/>probably would have been the case <lb/>had it been an
          incrustation. Its sur- <lb break="no"/>face is very black; the inside white <lb/>in some
          places, but dirty in others, <lb/>as appears where a piece is broken <lb/>off at (a); its
          thickness about two <lb/>lines. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Major Craig</persName>, the gentleman who <lb/>brought these fossils from
            <placeName>the Ohio</placeName>, <lb/>says, there were others, of the same <lb/>kind,
          much larger; and that he <lb/>has seen thigh-bones full eight <lb/>inches longer than that
          he brought. </p>
        <p> Before I quit this subject, I beg <lb/>leave to transcribe a passage in <persName>Dr.
            <lb/>Hunter's</persName> paper, and make a re- <lb break="no"/>mark thereon. </p>
        <p> “If this animal was indeed car- <lb break="no"/>nivorous, which I believe cannot <lb/>be
          doubted, though we may as <lb/>philosophers regret it; as men, we <lb/>cannot but thank
          Heaven that <lb/>its whole generation is probably <lb/>extinct.” </p>
        <cb/>
        <p> This sentence, I apprehend, con- <lb break="no"/>veys an idea injurious to the Deity;
          <lb/>who, at the creation, wanted nei- <lb break="no"/>ther foresight to discover how de-
            <lb break="no"/>trimental so powerful an enemy must <lb/>prove to the human, as well as
          ani- <lb break="no"/>mal race, or benevolence to prevent <lb/>the evil, without requiring
          or de- <lb break="no"/>pending on experience. I believe our <lb/>globe, and every part and
          particle <lb/>thereof, came out of the hand of its <lb/>Creator as perfect as he intended
          it <lb/>should be, and will continue in ex- <lb break="no"/>actly the same state (as to
          its inha- <lb break="no"/>bitants at least,) till its final disso- <lb break="no"/>lution.
          Particular species of ani- <lb break="no"/>mals may become extinct in some <lb/>places, as
          wolves in the <placeName>British <lb/>Islands</placeName>, but I cannot see any reason
          <lb/>to suppose any, the minutest <seg xml:id="a005" corresp="#n005">ani- <lb break="no"
            />malcule,</seg><note xml:id="n005" corresp="#a005"><term style="font-style: italic"
              >Animalcule</term>: a micro-organism.</note> even inferior to those dis- <lb
            break="no"/>coverable by the microscope, has <lb/>been, or ever will be, annihilated,
          <lb/>before this heaven and earth are <lb/>done away. I conceive, that wherever <lb/>any
          species fails in a country it for- <lb break="no"/>merly inhabited, and that human
          <lb/>agency, in the destruction thereof, <lb/>is not apparent, we may attribute <lb/>it to
          some unfavourable alteration <lb/>in the climate, and scarcity of their <lb/>accustomed
          food. </p>
        <p> It may appear surprising, that <lb/>those animal relicks in
            <placeName>Siberia</placeName> and <lb/><placeName>America</placeName>, are not found
          scattered <lb/>over the face of the country, but <lb/>deposited in particular places; but,
          <lb/>I believe, this may be accounted <lb/>for from the state in which they are
          <lb/>found. We cannot doubt that bones, <lb/>as well as other parts of animal <lb/>bodies,
          are liable to decay, but, <lb/>from their firmer texture, require <lb/>more time;
          therefore we may rea- <lb break="no"/>sonably conjecture, millions of such <lb/>bones as
          those under consideration, <lb/>have submitted to this general law, <lb/>and that those
          now found would <lb/>have suffered the same fate, had <pb/>
          <lb/>not they fallen in places endued <lb/>with petrifying qualities; which, by
          <lb/>changing their osseous into a lapi- <lb break="no"/>deous nature, has enabled them to
          <lb/>resist the dissolvent: another diffi- <lb break="no"/>culty remains, which is, to
          account <lb/>for the number collected in one place; <lb/>to which I shall offer the
          following <lb/>solution, as far as relates to <placeName>Ameri- <lb break="no"
            />ca</placeName>. It is well known, that all the <lb/>wild cattle of this country, such
          as <lb/>deers, buffaloes, &amp;c. are fond of <lb/>salt, and frequently resort to where
          <lb/>that mineral abounds, from which <lb/>circumstances they are called <hi
            rend="font-style: italic">salt- <lb/>licks</hi>; these are often found in marshy
          <lb/>ground, in which many beasts are <lb/>at certain seasons swamped, and se- <cb/>

          belonging to the or- <lb break="no"/>der of <hi rend="italic">Amphibia, Serpentes</hi>.
          The <lb/>characters of it are these: The <lb/>belly is furnished with seuta, and <lb/>the
          tail has both seuta and scales; <lb/>but the principal characteristic of <lb/>this genus
          is the rattle at the end <lb/>of its tail.”—See
              <choice><abbr>Encycl.</abbr><expan>Encyclopedia</expan></choice>
          <choice><abbr>Brit.</abbr><expan>Britannica</expan></choice>
          <lb/>title Crotalus Horridus. </p>
        <p> The rattle, which is of a brown <lb/>colour, consists of several articulated
          <lb/>undulatory fibulæ, which are hol- <lb break="no"/>low, and of a horny substance,
          <lb/>together composing a number of <lb/>membranaceous cells. Each fibula, <lb/>or button,
          as it appears to the eye <lb/>when joined with the rest, is of an <lb/>eliptical form,
          with the conjugate <lb/>or shortest diameter flattened, so as <lb/>to be about two lines
          in diameter <lb/>one way; and when taken the way <lb/>which composes the thickness of the
          <lb/>rattle, it is about four lines: the <clb/>
          <lb/>transverse diameter of each fibula <lb/>is about ¼ of an inch, as appears <lb/>by the
          plate. When I say that the <lb/>fibula, as it appears to the eye, is a <lb/>flattened
          ellipsis, I do not consider <lb/>the form of that part of each which <lb/>is contained in
          the succeeding ones, <lb/>of which the ellipsis before-men- <lb break="no"/>tioned is the
          basis. When a single <lb/>fibula is separated from the others, <lb/>and examined apart, it
          is of an oval <lb/>pyramidal figure; but that part of <lb/>the pyramidal fibula which has
          been <lb/>sheathed in the succeeding ones, <lb/>(for they all taper to the end of the
          <lb/>tail) is not so large where it joins <lb/>its base, or that part which always
          <lb/>appears, by two lines diameter. <lb/>These membranaceous cells are ar- <lb break="no"
          />ticulated within one another in such <lb/>a manner that the point of the first <lb/>from
          the insertion at the tail, reach- <lb break="no"/>es as far as the basis of the protube-
            <lb break="no"/>rant ring (or fibula) of the third, <lb/>and so on. This articulation is
          so <pb/>
          <lb/> wonderfully supported by the pro- <lb break="no"/>jection of the flat part of the
          fibula, <lb/>over a protuberance in the pyramid, <lb/>that it gives a freedom of motion to
          <lb/>the whole rattle; so that the parts <lb/>of the cells which are inclosed with- <lb
            break="no"/>in the outward rings, by striking <lb/>against their sides, cause that
          rattling <lb/>noise which is heard when the snake <lb/>shakes its tail. </p>
        <p> The common number of fibulæ <lb/>seldom exceeds 14 or 15 in a rattle <cb/>
          <lb/>—but the one given is certainly a <lb/>very great curiosity, even to a per- <lb
            break="no"/>son who has seen a great number of <lb/>this genus of snakes:—the fibulæ
          <lb/>are 44 in number.—The snake from <lb/>which this rattle was taken, was <lb/>not, as
          might be expected, of a <lb/>size proportionate to the prodigious <lb/>length of its
          rattle, but rather a <lb/>middling sized snake—It was killed <lb/>some time in the summer
          of this <lb/>year, near <placeName>Fort Allen</placeName>. </p>

        </p>
        <p> The wings of this wonderful ins- <lb break="no"/>ect still remain as a subject of en-
            <lb break="no"/>quiry. When the insect relieves it- <lb break="no"/>self from the outer
          covering or grub- <lb break="no"/>worm case (for I approve <name role="pseudonym" type="person">Philo- <lb/>Naturæ’s</name> term) the
          wings are of the <lb/>hue of rich milk. In this state, <lb/>the filaments, which add
          strength <lb/>to them, are of the same white co- <lb break="no"/>lour, and the
          transparency which <lb/>they afterwards attain, appears, at <lb/>this juncture, to be very
          unlikely <lb/>ever to be acquired. But as soon <lb/>as the moisture dries up from off
          <lb/>the wings of the insect, these fila- <lb break="no"/>ments become more firm, and have
          <lb/>a dark brown colour, which ap- <lb break="no"/>proaches a black, as the locust be-
            <lb break="no"/>comes stronger. </p>
        <p> The filaments of the wings are <lb/>spread by nature in a lively and di- <lb break="no"
          />versified manner; in some the strong- <lb break="no"/>est ones, which are near the base,
          <lb/>resemble the letter W—in others <cb/>
          <lb/>they display a form which must in- <lb break="no"/>terest the dullest fancy. </p>
        <p> The more inattentive and super- <lb break="no"/>stitious among mankind, have ter- <lb
            break="no"/>rified themselves with strange fore- <lb break="no"/>bodings from the sport
          of nature in <lb/>the wings of this insect, and many <lb/>are fully convinced that the
          curses <lb/>of war are denounced from the <lb/>wing of a locust, or that from this
          <lb/>source peace is proclaimed with cer- <lb break="no"/>tainty. Some years, it is true,
          the <lb/>letter W may be clearly distinguished <lb/>by a fancy not remarkable for its
          <lb/>activity. But I much doubt whe- <lb break="no"/>ther ever the happy letter P has
          <lb/>spread itself on this strange canopy <lb/>of peace. Be that as it may, the
          <lb/>common people can by no means be <lb/>persuaded to banish the idea that <lb/>they
          prognosticate peace or war. </p>
        <p> Whenever the insects appear in <lb/>prodigious numbers, which, as <name role="pseudonym" type="person">Phi- <lb break="no"
          />lo-Naturæ</name> observes, is the case every <lb/>15, 16, or 17 years, the lower <lb/>class are
          filled with apprehensions <lb/>of war, famine, and distress; and, <lb/>as if there were
          not real evils suf- <lb break="no"/>ficient to employ their timid fancies, <lb/>the
          purposely-forged sentiments of <lb/>Philosophers, suited to their own <pb/>
          <lb/> narrow ideas, are hackneyed round <lb/>with uncommon diligence. </p>
        <p> At the time of the astonishing <lb/>flight of the Cicada, which appeared <lb/>in <date
            when="1782">1782</date>, previous to the late glo- <lb break="no"/>rious peace, when the
          enjoyment of <lb/>our civil and religious liberties was <lb/>happily confirmed, the
          stronger fila- <lb break="no"/>ments of the wing resembled the <lb/>letter W, as before
          noticed. Yet <lb/>the timid apprehensions of weak <lb/>minds will still continue exerted
          in <lb/>supporting a theory, as groundless <lb/>as it is trivial. </p>
        <p> <name role="pseudonym" type="person">Philo-Naturæ</name> has not noticed <lb/>that some of this same genus ap- <lb break="no"/>pear
          annually; these, I suppose, are <lb/>merely <seg xml:id="a008" corresp="#n008"><hi

          small distincti- <lb break="no"/>ons in colour, but no characteris- <lb break="no"/>tics
          which differ from the genus to <lb/>which I have no doubt but they <lb/>belong. </p>
        <p> Those of the Cicada Septemde- <lb break="no"/>cim, which annually appear, are of <lb
            break="no"/>a greyish cast; the dark-brown or <lb/>amber colour which the others have,
          <lb/>appearing in these mottled with a <lb/>dirty white. </p>
        <p> I presume the reason so few of <lb/>them appear annually, is, that as <lb/>Nature in
          general is confident in <cb/>
          <lb/>the various modes of producing liv- <lb break="no"/>ing creatures, these insects
          being, <lb/>as I imagine, merely <hi rend="italic">lusus naturæ</hi>, <lb/>are produced
          from the worms which <lb/>have fallen from the trees, and <lb/>which early pass through
          the seve- <lb break="no"/>ral changes which <name role="pseudonym" type="person">Philo-Naturæ</name> <lb/>supposes they undergo: and
          some <lb/>appear in the locust or flying state <lb/>the first year, some the second,
          <lb/>third, &amp;c. and so on to the four- <lb break="no"/>teenth, and even fifteenth
          year— <lb/>but this is merely hypothesis.—Cer- <lb break="no"/>tain it is, that few are
          introduced <lb/>among us annually; and I believe <lb/>the few which do appear, seldom
          <lb/>meet with their mates. I have at- <lb break="no"/>tentively remarked them for several
          <lb/>successive years, and have never suc- <lb break="no"/>ceeded in my endeavours to take
          a <lb/>female, though I have, in one day, <lb/>taken two or three males. </p>
        <p> The plains of <placeName>North America</placeName>, <lb/>as also its forests, teem with
          ani- <lb break="no"/>mal, as well as vegetable life. The <lb/>vegetable kingdom has been,
          in <lb/>some degree, explored, and I sin- <lb break="no"/>cerely wish its votaries may
          pursue <lb/>their interesting inquiries. I could <lb/>also enjoy the descriptive pen of
          the <lb/>zoologist, and hope this branch <lb/>will frequently bud, blossom, and <lb/>bear
          its delightful fruit. </p>

        <p> I Sometimes relax myself from a <lb/>grave and dry study, by read- <lb break="no"/>ing a
          page or two in a medical <lb/>book.—In a visit to a gentleman of <lb/>the profession of
          physic, a few days <lb/>ago, I picked up a work written <lb/>by the celebrated <seg
            xml:id="a012" corresp="#n012"><persName>Dr. Cullen</persName>,</seg><note xml:id="n012"

              when="1790">1790</date>), known for his four volume nosology (classification of

          <lb/>which he has arranged diseases un- <lb break="no"/>der distinct classes—orders—
          genera <lb/>and species. My eye was caught <lb/>with the word <seg xml:id="a013"
            corresp="#n013">HYDROPHOBIA</seg><note xml:id="n013" corresp="#a013"><term
              style="font-style: italic">Hydrophobia</term>, a common eighteenth-century designation
            for what is today known as rabies.</note> which <lb/>our ingenious author subdivides
          into <lb/>two different species. The meaning <lb/>of the word, my medical friend in- <lb
            break="no"/>formed me, was “a dread of water” <lb/>—and that the name of the disease
          <lb/>is taken from the most predominant <lb/>symptom which occurs in patients <lb/>that
          are bitten by mad animals. <lb/>Without detracting from the merit <lb/>of <persName>Dr.
            Cullen</persName>, I cannot help think- <lb break="no"/>ing, that the genus of the
          disease <lb/>which he has named Hydrophobia, <lb/>should rather have been PHOBIA, and
          <lb/>that the number and names of the <lb/>species should have been taken from <lb/>the
          names of the objects of fear or <lb/>aversion. Impressed with this idea I <lb/>returned
          home, and committed to <lb/>paper the following new species <lb/>of PHOBIA, which, if they
          should not <lb/>be deemed worthy of a place in a <lb/>system of nosology, I hope will find
          <lb/>an humble corner in your Magazine. </p>
        <p> I shall begin, by defining PHOBIA <lb/>in the present instance, to be a fear <lb/>of an
          imaginary evil, or an undue <lb/>fear of a real one. </p>
        <p> The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> species of PHOBIA that <lb/>I shall name, is the CAT
          PHOBIA. <cb/>
          <lb/>It will be unnecessary to mention <lb/>instances of the prevalence of this
          <lb/>distemper. I know several gentle- <lb break="no"/>men of unquestionable courage, who
          <lb/>have retreated a thousand times from <lb/>the sight of a cat; and who have <lb/>even
          discovered signs of fear and <lb/>terror upon being confined in a room <lb/>with a cat
          that was out of sight. </p>
        <p> 2. The RAT PHOBIA is a more <lb/>common disease than the first species <lb/>that has
          been mentioned: It is pe- <lb break="no"/>culiar, in some measure to the fe- <lb
            break="no"/>male sex. I know several ladies <lb/>who never fail to discover their ter-
            <lb break="no"/>ror by screaming at the sight of a <lb/>rat; and who cannot even sleep
          <lb/>within the noise of that animal. </p>
        <p> 3. The INSECT PHOBIA. This <lb/>disease is peculiar to the female sex. <lb/>A spider—a
          flea—or a musqueto, <lb/>alighting upon a lady's neck, has <lb/>often produced an
          hysterical fit. To <lb/>compensate for this defect in the <lb/>constitutions of certain
          ladies, na- <lb break="no"/>ture has kindly endowed them with <lb/>the highest degree of
          courage, with <lb/>respect to the great object of reli- <lb break="no"/>gious fear. They

          cleanliness: the whole of <lb/>their lives is one continued warfare <lb/>with dirt—their
          rooms resound at <lb/>all hours with the noise of scrub- <lb break="no"/>bing brushes, and
          their entries are <lb/>obstructed three times a week, with <lb/>tubs and buckets. I have
          heard of <lb/>women, afflicted with this disease, <lb/>who sat constantly in their
          kitchens, <lb/>lest they should dirty their parlours. <lb/>I once saw one of those women
          in <lb/><placeName>New-Jersey</placeName>, fall down upon her <lb/>knees, with a house
          cloth in her <lb/>hand, and wipe away such of the <lb/>liquid parts of the food as fell
          upon <lb/>the floor from a company of gen- <lb break="no"/>tlemen, that dined in her
          house; <lb/>muttering, at the same time, the <lb/>most terrible complaints, in low
          <lb/>Dutch, of the beastly manners of <lb/>her guests. I have heard of a wo- <lb
            break="no"/>man in the same state, who never <lb/>received a visit from any person who
          <lb/>did not leave their shoes at her door <lb/>in muddy weather. She always had <lb/>a
          pair of slippers placed at the door, <lb/>for her visitors to put on, till their
          <lb/>shoes were cleaned by a servant. </p>
        <p> 6. The RUM PHOBIA is a very <lb/><hi rend="italic">rare</hi> distemper. I have known
          only <lb/>five instances of it in the course of <lb/>my life. The smell of rum, and <cb/>
          <lb/>of spirituous liquors of all kinds, <lb/>produced upon these persons, sick- <lb
            break="no"/>ness and distress. If it were possible <lb/>to communicate this distemper as
          <lb/>we do the small-pox, by inocula- <lb break="no"/>tion, I would recommend to the
          <lb/>faculty immediately to infect with it * * * * * * * * * * * * * <lb/>* * * * * * * *
          * * * </p>
        <p> 7. The WATER PHOBIA. This <lb/>species includes not the dread of <lb/>swallowing, but of
            <hi rend="italic">crossing</hi> water. <lb/>I have known some people who <lb/>sweat with
          terror in crossing an or- <lb break="no"/>dinary ferry. <seg xml:id="a018" corresp="#n018"

          men- <lb break="no"/>tion the remedy that cured him in <lb/>a future letter. As a variety
          of this <lb/>species of Water Phobia, may be <lb/>considered that aversion from drink- <lb
            break="no"/>ing water, which we sometimes ob- <lb break="no"/>serve in some men, without
          being <lb/>accompanied with a similar dislike <lb/>to artificial liquors. I recollect once
          <lb/>to have heard of a physician in this <lb/>city, who told a gentleman that was
          <lb/>afflicted with a <seg xml:id="a019" corresp="#n019">dropsy,</seg><note xml:id="n019"
            corresp="#a019"><term style="font-style: italic">Dropsy</term>: the accumulation of

          than three gallons <lb/>of water from him—“Of <emph style="font­-style: italic"

            <emph style="font­-style: italic">water</emph>
          <lb/>these twenty years.” </p>
        <p> 8. The SOLO PHOBIA; by which <lb/>I mean the dread of solitude. This <lb/>distemper is
          peculiar to persons of <lb/>vacant minds, and guilty con- <lb break="no"/>sciences. Such
          people cannot bear <lb/>to be alone, especially if the horror <lb/>of sickness is added to
          the pain of <lb/>attempting to <hi rend="italic">think</hi>, or to the ter- <lb break="no"
          />ror of <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi>. </p>
        <p> 9. The POWER PHOBIA. This <lb/>distemper belongs to certain dema- <lb break="no"
          />gogues. It has been epidemic lately <lb/>in <seg xml:id="a020" corresp="#n020"

            became increasingly active in the summer of <date when="1786">1786</date>.</note>
          Persons af- <lb break="no"/>flicted with it, consider power as an <lb/>evil—they abhor

        <p> 10. The WANT PHOBIA. This <lb/>disease is confined chiefly to old <lb/>people. It is not

          <lb/>pays it away. There are few old <lb/>men who part with money without <lb/>feeling
          some of the symptoms of an <lb/>intermitting fever. This distemper <lb/>has arisen to such
          a height, as to <lb/>furnish the most entertaining and lu- <lb break="no"/>dicrous scenes
          in plays and novels. <lb/>I have heard of an old gentleman in
            <lb/><placeName>London</placeName>, who had above £.20,000 <lb/>in the funds, who sold a
          valuable li- <lb break="no"/>brary a year or two before he died; <lb/>and gave as a reason
          for it, that <lb/>he was afraid he should not have <lb/>enough to bury him without mak-
            <lb break="no"/>ing that addition to his fortune. </p>
        <p> 11. The DOCTOR PHOBIA. This <lb/>distemper is often complicated with <lb/>other
          diseases. It arises in some <lb/>instances, from the dread of taking <lb/>physic, or of
          submitting to the re- <lb break="no"/>medies of bleeding and blistering. <lb/>In some
          instances I have known it <lb/>occasioned by a desire sick people <lb/>feel of deceiving
          themselves, by be- <lb break="no"/>ing kept in ignorance of the danger <lb/>of their
          disorders. It might be sup- <lb break="no"/>posed, that “the dread of a long <lb/>bill”
          was one cause of the Doctor <lb/>Phobia; but this excites terror in <lb/>the minds of but
          few people: for <lb/>whoever thinks of paying a doctor, <lb/>while he can use his money to
          ad- <lb break="no"/>vantage in another way?—It is re- <lb break="no"/>markable this Doctor
          Phobia always <lb/>goes <choice><sic>of</sic><corr>off</corr></choice> as soon as a
          patient is sensible <lb/>of his danger. The doctor, then, <lb/>becomes an object of
          respect and <lb/>attachment, instead of horror. </p>
        <cb/>
        <p> 12. The THUNDER PHOBIA. This <lb/>species is common to all ages, and <lb/>of both sexes:
          I have seen it pro- <lb break="no"/>duce the most distressing appearances <lb/>and
          emotions upon many people. <lb/>I know a man, whom the sight of <lb/>a black cloud in the
          morning, in <lb/>the season of thundergusts, never <lb/>fails to make melancholy during
          <lb/>the whole of the ensuing day. </p>
        <p> 13. The CHURCH PHOBIA. This <lb/>disease has become epidemic in the <lb/>city of
            <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, since the late <lb/>war: hence we find half the
          city <lb/>flying in chariots, <seg xml:id="a022" corresp="#n022">phaetons,</seg><note

          are opened for divine worship. <lb/>In the winter, when it is more dif- <lb break="no"
          />ficult to escape the horror of look- <lb break="no"/>ing into an open church, we observe
          <lb/>our citizens drowning their fear of <lb/>the church, in plentiful entertain- <lb
            break="no"/>ments. A short story will shew the <lb/>prevalence of this distemper in
            <placeName>Phi- <lb break="no"/>ladelphia</placeName>. The Sunday after the in- <lb

          her <lb/>in her own state, in the church, but <lb/>very kindly ascribed it to the polite-
            <lb break="no"/>ness of the ladies and gentlemen of
            <lb/><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, who had that day <lb/>given up their seats to
          accommo- <lb break="no"/>date the <placeName>Carolina</placeName> strangers. </p>
        <p> 14. The GHOST PHOBIA. This <lb/>distemper is most common among ser <lb break="no"/>vants
          and children. It manifests it- <lb break="no"/>self chiefly in passing by grave-yards,
          <lb/>and old empty houses. I have heard <lb/>of a few instances of grown people, <lb/>and
          of men of cultivated understand- <lb break="no"/>ings, who have been afflicted with
          <lb/>this species of Phobia. Physicians, <pb/>
          <lb/> who have sacrificed the lives of their <lb/>patients through carelessness, rash- <lb
            break="no"/>ness, or ignorance;—as also wit- <lb break="no"/>nesses who have convicted
          by their <lb/>evidence—judges, who have con- <lb break="no"/>demned by their influence—and
          <lb/>kings and governors who have exe- <lb break="no"/>cuted by their power, innocent per-
            <lb break="no"/>sons, through prejudice or resent- <lb break="no"/>ment, are all deeply
          affected with <lb/>the Ghost Phobia. Generals of ar- <lb break="no"/>mies, and military
          butchers, who <lb/>make war only to gratify ambition <lb/>or avarice, are likewise subject
          to <lb/>paroxysms of this disorder. The late <lb/>king of <seg xml:id="a024"

          <lb/>Phobia in all its horrors. </p>
        <p> 15. The DEATH PHOBIA. The <lb/>fear of death is natural to man— <lb/>but there are
          degrees of it which <lb/>constitute a <hi rend="italic">disease</hi>. It prevails chief-
            <lb break="no"/>ly among the rich—the luxurious— <lb/>and the profane. A man of plea-
            <lb break="no"/>sure in the city of <placeName>New-York</placeName>, used
          <lb/>frequently to say in his convivial <lb/>moments, that “this world would <lb/>be a
          most delightful place to live in, <lb/>if it were not for that cursed thing <cb/>
          <lb/>called death—it comes in and spoils <lb/>all<supplied>.</supplied>” The late king of
            <placeName>Prussia</placeName> always <lb/>concealed his occasional indispo- <lb
            break="no"/>sitions from his subjects, lest he <lb/>should be led after them to connect
          <lb/>the idea of his sickness with that of <lb/>his death. I have heard of a man, <lb/>who
          possessed this death Phobia in <lb/>so high a degree, that he never would <lb/>see his
          friends when they were sick— <lb/>avoided seeing funerals—and, upon <lb/>one occasion,
          threatened to kick a <lb/>sexton of the church out of his house, <lb/>for inviting him to
          the burial of one <lb/>of his neighbours.—It is remark- <lb break="no"/>able, that even
          old age, with all <lb/>its infirmities, will not subdue this <lb/>disease in some people.

        <p> FROM the earliest ages of the <lb/>delighted world, the science of astronomy <lb/>has
          deservedly claimed the superior <lb/>attention and admiration of man- <lb break="no"
          />kind.—A copious field is opened <lb/>by the labours and perseverance of <lb/>the
          penetrating astronomer; and by <lb/>his enquiries we are instructed and <cb/>
          <lb/>delighted. The pursuit yields us in- <lb break="no"/>expressible pleasure; and its
          bounds <lb/>cannot be overpassed, as the objects <lb/>originate from an inexhaustible
          <lb/>source. The sublimity of this sci- <lb break="no"/>ence, its excellence, and its
          utility, <lb/>must interest the human mind in <lb/>the cultivation of so important a <pb/>
          <lb/>subject; and the more closely it is <lb/>pursued, the more lively do the sub- <lb
            break="no"/>lime ideas it inculcates, animate the <lb/>enquirer. </p>
        <p> When we are persuaded that this <lb/>earth which we inhabit, is at so <lb/>great a
          distance from the sun, that, <cb/>
          <lb/>if viewed from thence, it would ap- <lb break="no"/>pear but as a mere point,
          notwith- <lb break="no"/>standing its circumference is known <lb/>to be 25,020 English
          miles, the in- <lb break="no"/>teresting train of ideas which over- <lb break="no"/>whelm
          us in torrents, only allow <lb/>us to exclaim, <lb/>
          <floatingText>
            <body> “These are thy glorious works, Parent of good! <lb/>“Almighty, thine universal
              frame! <lb/>“Thus wond’rous fair! THYSELF how wond’rous then! <lb/>“To us invisible,
              or dimly seen, <lb/>“In these thy lower works; yet these declare <lb/>“Thy goodness
              beyond thought—and power <seg xml:id="a028" corresp="#n028">supreme.”</seg><note

        <p> As we pursue the enquiry, and <lb/>discover that the sun’s distance, <lb/>which is at
          least ninety-seven mil- <lb break="no"/>lions of miles, is really exceeded by <lb/>the
          distance of the nearest fixed <lb/>star from our earth a million times <lb/>the sun’s
          distance from us, the mag- <lb break="no"/>nitude of the discovery almost sur- <lb
            break="no"/>passes our comprehension. </p>
        <p> The science of astronomy readily <lb/>introduces a conviction that the <lb/>frame of the
          universe is not confined <lb/>to, nor does it depend upon, the <lb/>order, motion, and
          revolutions of <lb/>only one sun and its attendant <lb/>worlds; but that an inconceivable
          <lb/>number of suns, worlds, and sys- <lb break="no"/>tems, are dispersed through bound-
            <lb break="no"/>less space. Was it decreed by him <lb/>who formed the glorious frame of
          <lb/>the heavens, that our sun, with the <lb/>planets which revolve around Him
          <lb/>(including our globe) should be an- <lb break="no"/>nihilated, their loss would be
          con- <lb break="no"/>sidered, by an eye that could take <lb/>in the whole, as trivial, in
          compa- <lb break="no"/>rison, as the loss of a grain of sand <lb/>from the sea shore. </p>
        <p> What interesting emotions does <lb/>this reflection excite in our minds! <lb/>in how
          solemn and awful a manner <lb/>should our adorations be directed <lb/>towards the supreme,
          infinite, and <lb/>incomprehensible author of nature! <lb/>From his hands hath he poured <cb/>
          <lb/>numberless myriads of suns, with <lb/>all their worlds revolving round <lb/>them, in
          motions immensely rapid, <lb/>yet calm, regular, and uniformly <lb/>exact, each invariably
          keeping its <lb/>path in the order prescribed by the <lb/>eternal Fiat. </p>
        <p> The foregoing cursory remarks <lb/>on this exhaustless source of human <lb/>enquiry
          appear necessary, in order to <lb/>introduce in this dissertation, a <lb/>short and
          familiar explanation of <lb/>the nature and causes of the eclipses <lb/>of the sun and
          moon, those two <lb/>great luminaries, which are given <lb/>as blessings to our earth. </p>
        <p> No part of astronomy is involved <lb/>in such difficulty as the doctrine of
          <lb/>eclipses (especially when the calcu- <lb break="no"/>lation of the eclipse of the sun
          is <lb/>limited and determined to a certain <lb/>latitude and longitude) on account
          <lb/>of the tedious computation of the <lb/>moon’s <seg xml:id="a029" corresp="#n029"

        <p> This branch is the most delicate <lb/>and valuable part of astronomy: and <lb/>so rare

        <p> A solar eclipse, that is, an eclipse <lb/>of the sun, is caused by the inter- <lb
            break="no"/>position of the moon between the <lb/>sun and earth, whereby some par- <lb
            break="no"/>ticular tract of the earth is deprived <lb/>of the sun’s light during the
          eclipse, <lb/>at which time other places of the <lb/>world have the full light of the sun.
          <lb/>An eclipse of the moon is produced <lb/>from the earth coming between the <lb/>sun
          and the moon; the moon in <lb/>that case falling into the earth’s <lb/>shadow, and having
          no light of her <lb/>own, suffers a real eclipse by the <lb/>earth’s intercepting the
          sun’s rays, <lb/>and thereby depriving her of his <lb/>light. In eclipses of the sun, the
          <lb/>moon, by reason of her motion from <lb/>west to east round the earth, first
          <lb/>enters on the west limb of the sun, <lb/>so that in solar eclipses, the begin- <lb
            break="no"/>ning is always on the west side of <lb/>the sun, and the ending on the east
          <lb/>side. The contrary must happen in <lb/>eclipses of the moon; for, her mo- <cb/>
          <lb break="no"/>tion round the earth (as was said <lb/>before) being from west to east,
          the <lb/>east part of her body must necessa- <lb break="no"/>rily first enter the earth’s
          shadow, <lb/>and therefore her eclipse always be- <lb break="no"/>gins on the east side
          and ends on the <lb/>west. The sun very seldom suffers <lb/>a total eclipse, but the moon
          fre- <lb break="no"/>quently does. An eclipse of the <lb/>moon appears the same, as to
          quan- <lb break="no"/>tity and duration, to every part of <lb/>the world where it can be
          seen— <lb/>An eclipse of the sun is not at- <lb break="no"/>tended with the like
          circumstances, <lb/>being at the same moment of time <lb/>less in one place than in
          another. <lb/>A solar eclipse may in one place be <lb/>total, and, at the same time, in
          ano- <lb break="no"/>ther part of the earth there will be <lb/>no eclipse at all. This is
          caused by <lb/>the moon’s vicinity to the earth, <lb/>whereby to some of the inhabitants
          <lb/>she will appear to be projected di- <lb break="no"/>rectly on the body of the sun, to
          <lb/>others she will appear on the east <lb/>side, and to some others on the west
          <lb/>side at the same instant of time, &amp;c. <lb/>An instance of which we shall have
            <lb/><date when="1787-06-15">June 15, 1787</date>, when the sun will <lb/>be totally
          eclipsed in the region of <lb/>the north frigid zone: At the dis- <lb break="no"/>tance of
          5° from the pole, 200 <lb/>miles in diameter of the earth’s sur- <lb break="no"/>face will
          then be involved in total <lb/>darkness. In all the northern parts <lb/>of Europe there
          will be more or <lb/>less of the sun eclipsed, according <lb/>as the place is situated in
          regard to <lb/>its distance from the centre of the <lb/>moon’s shadow. The exact time
          <lb/>in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> will be at 50 mi- <lb break="no"/>nutes past
          10 in the morning.— <lb/>In <placeName>America</placeName> it will be visible to the
          <lb/>northward of <placeName>Quebec</placeName>, but not to <lb/>the southward, although
          the sun <lb/>will then be many degrees above <lb/>our horizon. The sun being im- <lb
            break="no"/>mensely larger than the earth or <lb/>moon, it necessarily follows that <pb/>
          <lb/>their shadows are cones, which con- <lb break="no"/>tinually taper until they end in
          a <lb/>point. The length of the earth’s <lb/>shadow is at a mean 859,200 miles;
          <lb/>sometimes it exceeds this computa- <lb break="no"/>tion: at other seasons it is not
          so <lb/>great. The shadow of the moon at <lb/>a mean is 240,000 miles; this also
          <lb/>varies as the earth’s shadow does. <lb/>The moon’s distance from the earth <lb/>is
          sometimes just equal to the length <lb/>of her shadow, in which case should <lb/>there
          happen to be a solar eclipse, <lb/>the vertex of the shadow would <lb/>reach exactly to
          the earth; but in <lb/>other cases, wherein her distance is <lb/>more or less than her
          shadow, it <lb/>may either not reach the earth, or <lb/>may extend beyond it. There are
          <lb/>therefore certain eclipses of the sun, <lb/>wherein no part of the earth’s sur- <lb
            break="no"/>face is absolutely dark, because the <lb/>moon’s shadow terminates in a
          point <lb/>before it comes to the earth: In <lb/>some cases, only one spot will be
          <lb/>dark; but in some others (as in the <lb/>case mentioned) 200 miles in dia- <lb
            break="no"/>meter may be involved in total dark- <lb break="no"/>ness. </p>
        <p> When the dark shadow termi- <lb break="no"/>nates before it reaches the earth, a
          <lb/>beautiful luminous ring or <hi rend="italic">annulus</hi>
          <lb/>will appear round the edge of the <lb/>moon, to those who are under the <lb/>point of
          its shadow. This is called <lb/>an annular eclipse. At other times, <lb/>when the shadow
          extends to the <lb/>earth, or beyond it, the sun will <cb/>
          <lb/>be totally obscured to those in the <lb/>centre of the shadow, though this
          <lb/>effect may scarce remain an instant, <lb/>or but for a very short space of <lb/>time,
          according to the magnitude <lb/>of the shadow at the earth.—The <lb/>base of the earth’s
          shadow being <lb/>at the earth, its length is 8000 <lb/>miles, <seg xml:id="a032"

          but at the mean dis- <lb break="no"/>tance of the moon, it is only 5890 <lb/>miles in
          diameter. Now the moon’s <lb/>diameter is 2192 miles, therefore <lb/>the moon can be
          almost three times <lb/>contained in the earth’s shadow; <lb/>and hence it appears, that
          the moon <lb/>may pass through the earth’s sha- <lb break="no"/>dow at a considerable
          distance from <lb/>its centre, and yet be totally eclips- <lb break="no"/>ed, being so
          much exceeded in <lb/>magnitude by the earth. In the <lb/>great and total eclipse of the
          moon, <lb/>which will happen on the <date when="1787-01-03">3d of Ja- <lb break="no"
            />nuary, 1787</date>, of which the annexed <lb/>plate is an exact representation,
          <lb/>the moon’s centre passes within 200 <lb/>miles of the center of the shadow, <lb/>so
          that she will continue to be to- <lb break="no"/>tally eclipsed for one hour and thir- <lb
            break="no"/>ty-nine minutes. </p>

          <lb/>falling upon the moon’s orb, make <lb/>her appear visible. </p>

        <p> The <emph style="font­-style: italic">first</emph> settler in the woods is
          <lb/>generally a man who has outlived <lb/>his credit or fortune in the culti- <lb
            break="no"/>vated parts of the state. His time <lb/>for migrating is in the month of
          <lb/>April. His first object is to build <lb/>a small cabbin of rough logs for
          <lb/>himself and family. The floor of <lb/>this cabbin is of earth, the roof is <lb/>of
          split logs—the light is received <lb/>through the door, and, in some in- <lb break="no"
          />stances, thro’ a small window made <lb/>of greased paper. A coarser build- <lb
            break="no"/>ing adjoining this cabbin affords a <lb/>shelter to a cow, and pair of poor
          <lb/>horses. The labour of erecting these <lb/>buildings is succeeded by killing the
          <lb/>trees on a few acres of ground near <lb/>his cabbin; this is done by cutting <lb/>a
          circle round the trees, two or three <lb/>feet from the ground. The ground <lb/>around
          these trees is then ploughed <lb/>and Indian-corn planted in it. The <lb/>season for
          planting this grain is <lb/>about the 20th of May—It grows <lb/>generally on new ground
          with but <cb/>
          <lb/>little cultivation, and yields in the <lb/>month of October following, from <lb/>40
          to 50 bushels per acre. After <lb/><choice><sic>ter</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> first
          of September it affords <lb/>a good deal of nourishment to his <lb/>family, in its green
          or unripe state, <lb/>in the form of what is called <hi rend="italic">roast- <lb
              break="no"/>ing ears</hi>. His family is fed during <lb/>the summer by a small
          quantity of <lb/>grain which he carries with him, <lb/>and by fish and game. His cows
          <lb/>and horses feed upon wild grass, <lb/>or the succulent twigs of the woods. <lb/>For
          the first year he endures a great <lb/>deal of distress from hunger—cold <lb/>and a
          variety of accidental causes, <lb/>but he seldom complains or sinks <lb/>under them. As he
          lives in the <lb/>neighbourhood of Indians, he soon <lb/>acquires a strong tincture of
          their <lb/>manners. His exertions, while they <lb/>continue, are violent; but they
          <lb/>are succeeded by long intervals of <lb/>rest. His pleasures consist chiefly <lb/>in
          fishing and hunting. He loves <lb/>spirituous liquors, and he eats, <lb/>drinks and sleeps
          in dirt and rags <lb/>in his little cabbin. In his inter- <lb break="no"/>course with the
          world, he mani- <lb break="no"/>fests all the arts which characterise <lb/>the Indians of
          our country. In <lb/>this situation he passes two or three <lb/>years. In proportion as
          popula- <lb break="no"/>tion increases around him, he be- <lb break="no"/>comes uneasy and
          dissatisfied. For- <lb break="no"/>merly his cattle ranged at large, <lb/>but now his
          neighbours call upon <lb/>him to confine them within fences, <lb/>to prevent their
          trespassing upon <lb/>their fields of grain. Formerly he <lb/>fed his family with wild
          animals, <lb/>but these which fly from the face <lb/>of man, now cease to afford him an
          <lb/>easy subsistence, and he is compelled <pb/>
          <lb/> to raise domestic animals for the <lb/>support of his family. Above all, <lb/>he
          revolts against the operation of <lb/>laws. He cannot bear to surrender <lb/>up a single
          natural right for all the <lb/>benefits of government—and there- <lb break="no"/>fore he
          abandons his little settle- <lb break="no"/>ment, and seeks a retreat in the <lb/>woods,
          where he again submits to <lb/>all the toils which have been men- <lb break="no"/>tioned.
          There are instances of ma- <lb break="no"/>ny men who have broken ground on <lb/>bare
          creation, not less than four <lb/>different times in this way, in dif- <lb break="no"
          />ferent and more advanced parts of <lb/>the State. It has been remarked, <lb/>that the
          flight of this class of peo- <lb break="no"/>ple is always increased by the preach- <lb
            break="no"/>ing of the gospel. This will not sur- <lb break="no"/>prise us when we
          consider how op- <lb break="no"/>posite its precepts are to their li- <lb break="no"
          />centious manner of living. If our <lb/>first settler was the owner of the spot <lb/>of
          land which he began to cultivate, <lb/>he sells it at a considerable profit to <lb/>his
          successor; but if (as is oftener <lb/>the case) he was the tenant to some <lb/>rich
          landholder, he abandons it in <lb/>debt; however, the small improve- <lb break="no"/>ments
          he leaves behind him, gene- <lb break="no"/>rally make it an object of imme- <lb
            break="no"/>diate demand to a <emph style="font­-style: italic">second</emph> species of
          <lb/>settler. </p>
        <p> This species of settler is generally <lb/>a man of some property—he pays <lb/>one-third
          or one-fourth part in cash <lb/>for his plantation, which consists of <lb/>three or four
          hundred acres, and <lb/>the rest in <note xml:id="n035" corresp="#a035">gales</note><note
            xml:id="n035" corresp="#a035"><term style="font-style: italic">Gales</term>: periodic
            payments, especially of rent.</note> or instalments, as <lb/>it is called here; that is,
          a certain <lb/>sum yearly, without interest, till <lb/>the whole is paid. The first object
          <lb/>of this settler is to build an addi- <lb break="no"/>tion to his cabbin; this is done
          <lb/>with hewed logs: and as saw-mills <lb/>generally follow settlements, his <lb/>floors
          are made of boards; his roof is <lb/>made of what are called clapboards, <lb/>which are a
          kind of coarse shingles, <cb/>
          <lb/>split out of short oak logs. This <lb/>house is divided by two floors, on <lb/>each
          of which are two rooms: un- <lb break="no"/>der the whole is a cellar walled with
          <lb/>stone. The cabbin serves as a <lb/>kitchen to this house. His next <lb/>object is to
          clear a little meadow <lb/>ground, and plant an orchard of <lb/>two or three hundred
          apple-trees. <lb/>His stable is likewise enlarged; and, <lb/>in the course of a year or
          two, he <lb/>builds a large log barn, the roof of <lb/>which is commonly thatched with
          <lb/>rye straw: he moreover increases the <lb/>quantity of his arable land; and, in- <lb
            break="no"/>stead of cultivating Indian corn <lb/>alone, he raises a quantity of wheat
          <lb/>and rye: the latter is cultivated <lb/>chiefly for the purpose of being dis- <lb
            break="no"/>tilled into whiskey. This species <lb/>of settler by no means extracts all
          <lb/>from the earth, which it is able and <lb/>willing to give. His fields yield but
          <lb/>a scanty increase, owing to the ground <lb/>not being sufficiently ploughed. The
          <lb/>hopes of the year are often blasted <lb/>by his cattle breaking through his <lb/>half
          made fences, and destroying his <lb/>grain. His horses perform but half <lb/>the labour
          that might be expected <lb/>from them, if they were better fed; <lb/>and his cattle often
          die in the spring <lb/>from the want of provision, and the <lb/>delay of grass. His house,
          as well <lb/>as his farm, bear many marks of a <lb/>weak tone of mind. His windows are
          <lb/>unglazed, or, if they have had glass <lb/>in them, the ruins of it are supplied
          <lb/>with old hats or pillows. This spe- <lb break="no"/>cies of settler is seldom a good
          mem- <lb break="no"/>ber of civil or religious society: <lb/>with a large portion of a
          heredi- <lb break="no"/>tary mechanical kind of religion, he <lb/>neglects to contribute
          sufficiently to- <lb break="no"/>wards building a church, or main- <lb break="no"/>taining
          a regular administration of <lb/>the ordinances of the gospel: he is <lb/>equally
          indisposed to support civil <lb/>government: with high ideas of <pb/>
          <lb/> liberty<choice><sic>;</sic><corr>,</corr></choice> he refuses to bear his pro- <lb
            break="no"/>portion of the debt contracted by <lb/>its establishment in our country: he
          <lb/>delights chiefly in company—some- <lb break="no"/>times drinks spirituous liquors to
          <lb/>excess—will spend a day or two in <lb/>every week, in attending political
          <lb/>meetings: and, thus, he contracts <lb/>debts, which (if they do not give <lb/>him a
          place in the sheriff’s docket) <lb/>compel him to sell his plantation, <lb/>generally in
          the course of a few <lb/>years, to the <emph style="font­-style: italic">third</emph> and
          last species <lb/>of settler. </p>
        <p> This species of settler is com- <lb break="no"/>monly a man of property and good
          <lb/>character—sometimes he is the son <lb/>of a wealthy farmer in one of the
          <lb/>interior and ancient counties of the <lb/>state. His first object is to convert
          <lb/>every spot of ground, over which <lb/>he is able to draw water, into mea- <lb
            break="no"/>dow: where this cannot be done, <lb/>he selects the most fertile spot on
          <lb/>the farm, and devotes it by manure <lb/>to that purpose. His next object <lb/>is to
          build a barn, which he prefers <lb/>of stone. This building is, in some <lb/>instances,
          100 feet in front, and 40 <lb/>in depth: it is made very compact, <lb/>so as to shut out
          the cold in winter; <lb/>for our farmers find that their horses <lb/>and cattle, when kept
          warm, do not <lb/>require near as much food as when <lb/>they are exposed to the cold. He
          <lb/>uses œconomy, likewise, in the con- <lb break="no"/>sumption of his wood. Hence he
          <lb/>keeps himself warm in winter, by <lb/>means of stoves, which save an im- <lb
            break="no"/>mense deal of labour to himself and <lb/>his horses, in cutting and hawling
          <lb/>wood in cold and wet weather. <lb/>His fences are every where repaired, <lb/>so as to
          secure his grain from his <lb/>own and his neighbour’s cattle. But <lb/>further, he
          increases the number of <lb/>the articles of his cultivation, and, <lb/>instead of raising
          corn, wheat, and <lb/>rye alone, he raises oats, buckwheat, <cb/>
          <lb/>(the <seg xml:id="a036" corresp="#n036">fagopyrum of Linnæus</seg><note xml:id="n036"

          allots <lb/>an acre or two of ground for a gar- <lb break="no"/>den, in which he raises a
          large quan- <lb break="no"/>tity of cabbage and potatoes. His <lb/>newly cleared fields
          afford him every <lb/>year a large increase of turnips. <lb/>Over the spring which
          supplies him <lb/>with water, he builds a milk-house: <lb/>he likewise adds to the number,
          and <lb/>improves the quantity of his fruit- <lb/>trees:—his sons work by his side
          <lb/>all the year, and his wife and daugh- <lb break="no"/>ters forsake the dairy and the
          spin- <lb break="no"/>ning wheel to share with him in the <lb/>toils of harvest. The last
          object of <lb/>his industry is to build a dwelling- <lb/>house. This business is sometimes
          <lb/>effected in the course of his life, but <lb/>is oftener bequeathed to his son, or
          <lb/>the inheritor of his plantation: and <lb/>hence we have a common saying a- <lb
            break="no"/>mong our best farmers, “that a son <lb/>should always begin where his fa-
            <lb break="no"/>ther left off;” that is, he should <lb/>begin his improvements, by
          build- <lb break="no"/>ing a commodious dwelling-house, <lb/>suited to the improvements
          and va- <lb break="no"/>lue of the plantation. This dwell- <lb break="no"/>ing-house is
          generally built of stone <lb/>—it is large, convenient, and filled <lb/>with useful and
          substantial furniture. <lb/>It sometimes adjoins the house of the <lb/>second settler, but
          is frequently plac- <lb break="no"/>ed at a little distance from it. The <lb/>horses and
          cattle of this species of <lb/>settler, bear marks in their strength, <lb/>fat, and
          fruitfulness—of their being <lb/>plentifully fed and carefully kept. <lb/>His table
          abounds with a variety of <lb/>the best provisions—his very kitchen <lb/>flows with milk
          and honey—beer, <lb/>cider, and wine are the usual drinks <lb/>of his family: the greatest
          part of <lb/>the clothing of his family is manu- <lb break="no"/>factured by his wife and
          daughters: <lb/>In proportion as he increases in <lb/>wealth, he values the protection of
          <lb/>laws: hence he punctually pays <pb/>
          <lb/> his taxes towards the support of <lb/>government. Schools and churches
          <lb/>likewise, as the means of promot- <lb break="no"/>ing order and happiness in society,
          <lb/>derive a due support from him; for <lb/>benevolence and public spirit, as <lb/>to
          these objects, are the natural <lb/>offspring of affluence and indepen- <lb break="no"
          />dence. Of this class of settlers <lb/>are two thirds of the farmers of
            <lb/><placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>: These are the men to <lb/>whom
            <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> owes her an- <lb break="no"/>cient fame and

          cul- <lb break="no"/>tivate their lands with slaves, they <lb/>possess more republican
          virtue. It <lb/>was from the farms cultivated by <lb/>these men, that the American and

            unoccupied lands are sold by the state for about six guineas, inclusive of all charges,
            per hundred acres. But as most of the lands that are settled, are procured from persons
            who had purchased them from the state, they are sold to the first settler for a much
            higher price. The quality of the soil—its vicinity to mills, court-houses, places of
            worship, and navigable water—the distance of land carriage to the sea-ports of
              <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> or <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, and the
            nature of the roads—all influence the price of land to the first settler. The quantity
            of cleared land, and the nature of the improvements, added to all the above
            circumstances, influence the price of farms to the second and third settlers. Hence the
            price of land to the first settler is from a quarter of a guinea to two guineas per
            acre; and the price of farms is from one guinea to ten guineas per acre, to the second
            and third settlers, according as the land is varied by the before-mentioned
            circumstances. When the first settler is unable to purchase, he often takes a tract of
            land for seven years on a lease, and contracts, instead of paying a rent in cash, to
            clear 50 acres of land, to build a log cabbin, and a barn, and to plant an orchard on
            it. The tract, after the expiration of this lease, sells or rents for a considerable
            profit. [Note in the original]</note> the credit <lb/>which arises from prudence, and

            break="no"/>der the blessings which I have de- <lb break="no"/>scribed, objects within
          the reach of <lb/>every man. </p>
        <p> From a review of the three dif- <lb break="no"/>ferent species of settlers, it appears,
          <lb/>that there are certain regular stages <lb/>which mark the progress from the
          <lb/>savage to civilized life. The first <lb/>settler is nearly related to an Indian
          <lb/>in his manners—In the second, the <lb/>Indian manners are more diluted: <lb/>It is in
          the third species of settlers <lb/>only, that we behold civilization <lb/>completed—It is
          to the third spe- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>cies of settlers only, that it is pro- <lb break="no"/>per to apply the
          term of <emph style="font­-style: italic">farmers</emph>. <lb/>While we record the vices
          of the <lb/>first and second settlers, it is but <lb/>just to mention their virtues like-
            <lb break="no"/>wise.—Their mutual wants produce <lb/>mutual dependence; hence they
          <lb/>are kind and friendly to each other <lb/>—their solitary situation makes vi- <lb
            break="no"/>siters agreeable to them; hence they <lb/>are hospitable to strangers: Their
          <lb/>want of money, (for they raise but <lb/>little more than is necessary to sup- <lb
            break="no"/>port their families) has made it ne- <lb break="no"/>cessary for them to
          associate for the <lb/>purposes of building houses, cutting <lb/>their grain, and the
          like:—This <lb/>they do in turns for each other, <lb/>without any other pay than the plea-
            <lb break="no"/>sures which usually attend a coun- <lb break="no"/>try frolic. Perhaps,
          what I have <lb/>called virtues, are rather <emph style="font­-style: italic"
            >qualities</emph>, <lb/>arising from necessity, and the pe- <lb break="no"/>culiar state
          of society in which these <lb/>people live. Virtue should, in all cases, <lb/>be the
          offspring of principle. </p>
        <p> I do not pretend to say, that this <lb/>mode of settling farms in <placeName>Pennsyl-
              <lb break="no"/>vania</placeName> is universal—I have known <lb/>some instances where
          the first settler <lb/>has performed the improvements <lb/>of the second, and yielded to
          the <lb/>third. I have known a few instances <lb/>likewise, of men of enterprising spi-
            <lb break="no"/>rits, who have settled in the wilder- <lb break="no"/>ness, and who, in
          the course of a <lb/>single life, have advanced through <lb/>all the intermediate stages
          of im- <lb break="no"/>provement that I have mentioned, <lb/>and produced all those
          conveniences <lb/>which have been ascribed to the <lb/>third species of settlers; thereby
          <lb/>resembling, in their exploits, not <lb/>only the pioneers and light infantry,
          <lb/>but the main body of an army. <lb/>There are instances, likewise, where <lb/>the
          first settlement has been improv- <lb break="no"/>ed by the fame family in hereditary
          <lb/>succession, till it has reached the <cb/>
          <lb/>third stage of cultivation. There <lb/>are many spacious stone houses, and
          <lb/>highly cultivated farms in the neigh- <lb break="no"/>bouring counties of the city of
            <placeName>Phi- <lb break="no"/>ladelphia</placeName>, which are possessed by the
          <lb/>grandsons and great-grandsons of <lb/>men who accompanied <persName>William
            Penn</persName>
          <lb/>across the ocean, and who laid the <lb/>foundation of the present improve- <lb
            break="no"/>ments of their posterity, in such <lb/>cabbins as have been described. </p>
        <p> I dare say this passion for migra- <lb break="no"/>tion which I have described, will
          <lb/>appear strange to the European. To <lb/>see men turn their backs upon the <lb/>houses
          in which they drew their first <lb/>breath—upon the church in which <lb/>they were
          dedicated to God—upon <lb/>the graves of their ancestors—upon <lb/>the friends and
          companions of their <lb/>youth—and upon all the pleasures <lb/>of cultivated society, and
          exposing <lb/>themselves to all the hardships and <lb/>accidents of subduing the earth,
          and <lb/>thereby establishing settlements in <lb/>a wilderness, must strike a philoso- <lb
            break="no"/>pher on your side the water, as a <lb/>picture of human nature that runs
          <lb/>counter to the usual habits and <lb/>principles of action in man. But <lb/>this
          passion, strange and new as it <lb/>appears, is wisely calculated for the <lb/>extension
          of population in <placeName>Ameri- <lb break="no"/>ca</placeName>; and this it does, not
          only by <lb/>promoting the increase of the hu- <lb break="no"/>man species in new
          settlements, but <lb/>in the old settlements likewise. While <lb/>the degrees of industry
          and know- <lb break="no"/>ledge in agriculture, in our coun- <lb break="no"/>try, are
          proportioned to farms of <lb/>from 75 to 300 acres, there will be <lb/>a languor in
          population, as soon as <lb/>farmers multiply beyond the num- <lb break="no"/>ber of farms
          of the above dimensions. <lb/>To remove this languor, which is <lb/>kept up alike by the
          increase of the <lb/>price, and the division of farms, a <lb/>migration of part of the
          community <lb/>becomes absolutely necessary. And <pb/>
          <lb/>as this part of the community often <lb/>consists of the idle and extravagant,
          <lb/>who eat without working, their re- <lb break="no"/>moval, by increasing the facility
          of <lb/>subsistence to the frugal and indus- <lb break="no"/>trious who remain behind,
          natu- <lb break="no"/>rally increases the number of peo- <lb break="no"/>ple, just as the
          cutting off the suck- <lb break="no"/>ers of an appletree increases the size <lb/>of the
          tree, and the quantity of the fruit. </p>
        <p> I have only to add upon this sub- <lb break="no"/>ject, that the migrants from
            <placeName>Penn- <lb break="no"/>sylvania</placeName> always travel to the south- <lb
            break="no"/>ward. The soil and climate of the <lb/>western parts of
            <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, <placeName>North and <lb/>South Carolina</placeName>,
          and <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, af- <lb break="no"/>ford a more easy support to lazy
          <lb/>farmers, than the stubborn but du- <lb break="no"/>rable soil of
            <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>. <emph style="font­-style: italic">Here</emph> our
          <lb/>ground requires deep and repeated <lb/>ploughing to render it fruitful; <emph

          <lb/>scratching the ground once or <lb/>twice affords tolerable crops. In

          <lb/>share of their labour in providing for, <lb/>and feeding their cattle; but in the
          <lb/>southern states, cattle find pasture <lb/>during the greatest part of the win- <lb
            break="no"/>ter, in the fields or woods. For <lb/>these reasons, the greatest part of
          <lb/>the western counties of the states <lb/>that have been mentioned, are set- <lb
            break="no"/>tled by original inhabitants of <placeName>Penn- <lb break="no"
            />sylvania</placeName>. During the late war, the <lb/>militia of
            <placeName>Orange-county</placeName>, in <placeName>North- <lb/>Carolina</placeName>,
          were enrolled, and their <cb/>
          <lb/>number amounted to 3,500, <emph style="font­-style: italic">every</emph>
          <lb/>man of whom had migrated from <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>. From this you will
          <lb/>see, that our state is the great out- <lb break="no"/>port for the <placeName>United
            States</placeName> for Eu- <lb break="no"/>ropeans; and that, after perform- <lb
            break="no"/>ing the office of a sieve, by detain- <lb break="no"/>ing all those people
          who possess the <lb/>stamina of industry and virtue, it <lb/>allows a passage to the rest,

        <p> I shall conclude this letter by re- <lb break="no"/>marking, that in the mode of ex- <lb
            break="no"/>tending population and agriculture, <lb/>which I have described, we behold
          <lb/>a new species of war. The <emph style="font­-style: italic">third</emph>
          <lb/>settler may be viewed as a con- <lb break="no"/>queror. The weapons with which
          <lb/>he atchieves his conquests, are the <lb/>implements of husbandry; and the
          <lb/>virtues which direct them, are in- <lb break="no"/>dustry and œconomy. Idleness, ex-
            <lb break="no"/>travagance, and ignorance fly be- <lb break="no"/>fore him. Happy would
          it be for <lb/>mankind, if the kings of <placeName>Europe</placeName>
          <lb/>would adopt this mode of extending <lb/>their territories; it would soon put <lb/>an
          end to the dreadful connection, <lb/>which has existed in every age, be- <lb break="no"

                <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, &amp;c.”</bibl></note></head>

        <p> The winter of <date when="1783">1783</date>-<date when="1784">4</date> was
          <lb/>uncommonly cold, insomuch <lb/>that the mercury in <persName>Farenheit’s</persName>
          <lb/>thermometer stood several days at 10 <lb/>degrees below 0. The snows were
          <lb/>frequent; and, in many places, <lb/>from two to three feet deep, during <lb/>the
          greatest part of the winter. All <lb/>the rivers in <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>
          were <lb/>frozen, so as to bear waggons and <lb/>sleds with immense weights. In <lb/>the
          month of <date when="1784-01">January</date> a thaw came <lb/>on suddenly, which opened our <lb/>rivers, so as to set
          the ice a driving, <lb/>to use the phrase of the country. <lb/>In the course of one night,
          during <lb/>the thaw, the wind shifted sudden- <lb break="no"/>ly to the north-west, and
          the wea- <lb break="no"/>ther became intensely cold. The <lb/>ice, which had floated the
          day be- <lb break="no"/>fore, was suddenly obstructed; and <lb/>in the <placeName>river
            Susquehannah</placeName>, the ob- <lb break="no"/>structions were formed in those
          <lb/>places where the water was most <lb/>shallow, or where it had been ac- <lb break="no"
          />customed to fall. This river is se- <lb break="no"/>veral hundred miles in length, and
          <lb/>from half a mile to a mile and <choice><orig>an</orig><reg>a</reg></choice>
          <lb/>half in breadth; and winds thro’ a <lb/>hilly, and in many places a fertile <lb/>and
          highly cultivated country. It <lb/>has as yet a most difficult commu- <lb break="no"
          />nication with our bays and the sea, <lb/>occasioned by the number and height <lb/>of the
          falls which occur near the <lb/>mouth of the river. The ice in <lb/>many places,
          especially where there <lb/>were falls, formed a kind of dam, <lb/>of a most stupendous
          height. A- <lb break="no"/>bout the middle of <date when="1784-03">March</date> our wea- <lb break="no"/>ther
          moderated, and a thaw became <lb/>general. The effects of it were re- <lb break="no"
          />markable in all our rivers; but in <lb/>none so much so as in the river <lb/>which I
          have mentioned. I shall <cb/>
          <lb/>therefore endeavour in a few words <lb/>to describe them. Unfortunately <lb/>the dams
          of ice did not give way <lb/>all at once, nor those which lay <lb/>nearest to the mouth of
          the river, <lb/>first. While the upper dams were <lb/>set afloat by the warm weather,
          <lb/>the lower ones, which were the <lb/>largest, and of course the ice was <lb/>most
          impacted in them, remained <lb/>fixed. In consequence of this, the <lb/>river rose in a
          few hours, in many <lb/>places, above 30 feet; rolling upon <lb/>its surface large lumps
          of ice, from <lb/>10 to 40 cubic feet in size. The <lb/>effects of this sudden inundation
          <lb/>were intolerable. Whole farms were <lb/>laid under water. Barns—stables—
          <lb/>horses—cattle—fences—mills of e- <lb break="no"/>very kind, and in one instance, a
          <lb/>large stone house, 40 by 30 feet, <lb/>were carried down the stream. <lb/>Large trees
          were torn up by the <lb/>roots—several small islands covered <lb/>with woods, were swept
          away, and <lb/>not a vestige of them was left be- <lb break="no"/>hind. On the barns which
          pre- <lb break="no"/>served their shape, in some instances, <lb/>for many miles were to be
          seen living <lb/>fowls; and, in one dwelling, a <lb/>candle was seen to burn for some
          <lb/>time, after it was swept from its <lb/>foundation. Where the shore was <lb/>level,
          the lumps of ice, and the ruins <lb/>of houses and farms, were thrown a <lb/>quarter of a
          mile from the ordinary <lb/>height of the river. In some in- <lb break="no"/>stances,
          farms were ruined by the <lb/><seg xml:id="a040" corresp="#n040">mould</seg><note

          <lb/>the terrible effects of their being set <lb/>in motion by means of a general
          <lb/>thaw, may in part be obviated, by <lb/>removing such things out of the <lb/>course of
          the water and ice, as are <lb/>within our power; particularly cat- <lb break="no"/>tle,
          hay, grain, fences, and farm- <lb break="no"/>ing utensils of all kinds. </p>

        <head style="text-align:center; font-style:italic">Some Thoughts on real and imaginary
          Evils.</head>

        <p> SELF-tormenting is so general, <lb/>as to have raised a doubt among <lb/>many, whether
          mankind do not suf- <lb break="no"/>fer more from imaginary ills than <lb/>real? The
          question is very impor- <lb break="no"/>tant, as a full resolution of it points <lb/>out
          the means of lessening the mi- <lb break="no"/>sery of human life. To do this, it <lb/>is
          necessary, first to determine the <lb/>nature of imaginary evils—It is very <lb/>wrong to
          suppose good and evil <lb/>seated merely in external objects, <lb/>independent of our
          senses, and to <lb/>distinguish those by the appellation <lb/>of real, in opposition to
          others which <lb/>are regarded as existing only in our <lb/>opinion, fancy, affections,
          and feel- <lb break="no"/>ings of whatever kind; because <lb/>good and evil signify pain
          and plea- <lb break="no"/>sure, and cannot exist without some <lb/>feeling being, but are
          so only with <lb/>respect to the senses of that being. <lb/>The sweetness of sugar does
          not <lb/>consist entirely in its own form and <lb/>texture, but in the correspondence
          <lb/>of this with the structure of our pa- <lb break="no"/>lates. Certain figures and
          colours <lb/>please, because adapted to our eyes: <lb/>In like manner, science and virtue
          <lb/>are agreeable to our intellectual and <lb/>moral faculties. If this was not <lb/>the
          case, every species of good and <lb/>ill would affect all beings, and in <lb/>the same
          degree; whereas the high- <lb break="no"/>est enjoyments of one class, are of- <lb
            break="no"/>ten insipid or nauseous to another. <cb/>
          <lb/>The salutary and grateful food of Llb/some animals, is present poison to <lb/>others;
          the sentimental delights of <lb/>a man of refined taste, are not con- <lb break="no"
          />ceived by his lower fellow-creatures. <lb/>Individuals of the same species are <lb/>very
          unequally affected by the same <lb/>objects, and often the same person <lb/>at different
          times. Some men have <lb/>no ear for music, or no eye for ma- <lb break="no"/>ny species
          of beauty; others no <lb/>taste for mathematics, or no admi- <lb break="no"/>ration for
          the grand and heroic vir- <lb break="no"/>tues. Every person knows how <lb/>much he
          differs from himself, in <lb/>health and sickness, leisure and busi- <lb break="no"/>ness,
          good and ill humour. Ima- <lb break="no"/>ginary evils may then be defined to <lb/>be such
          as are created by our own <lb/>fancy, without any real foundation. <lb/>A full enquiry
          into the nature of <lb/>these, and the proper remedies, <lb/>would be ample matter for a
          philo- <lb break="no"/>sophical treatise. My narrow limits <lb/>admit only a sketch of the
          outlines. <lb/>As in a sound constitution the pas- <lb break="no"/>sions are not merely
          sources of pain; <lb/>we ought not therefore to endeavour <lb/>entirely to suppress them.
          Such as <lb/>appear so, are either in their effects <lb/>instrumental to our happiness, or
          so <lb/>interwoven with the pleasing affec- <lb break="no"/>tions and active principles,
          as to im- <lb break="no"/>pair them if too much weakened. <lb/>Anger, for instance,
          prompts to <lb/>self defence, animates our zeal for <pb/>
          <lb/>injured worth, friends, and a good <lb/>cause, inspires fortitude, and gives <lb/>new
          ardour to ambition:—In fact, <lb/>noble and vigorous minds seldom <lb/>want a proper
          degree of spirit, and <lb/>persons too easy and gentle, are <lb/>often, with the best
          dispositions, <lb/>deficient to themselves, their friends, <lb/>to God and their
          country.—Fear, <lb/>often averts the ill we apprehend; <lb/>in a proper degree, it is then
          nearly <lb/>allied to prudence. The fool-hardy <lb/>is a despicable and dangerous cha- <lb
            break="no"/>racter—a rational being cannot help <lb/>reflecting on his present misery,
          nor <lb/>regretting the happiness lost:—A <lb/>bosom incapable of sorrow can feel <lb/>no
          raptures, and phlegmatic tem- <lb break="no"/>pers are by no means the happiest; <lb/>this
          disposition for grief is also very <lb/>beneficial.—The reflecting mind re- <lb break="no"
          />presents its feelings in an eventual <lb/>situation, recoils, with horror, from <lb/>it,
          and exerts every means of an <lb/>escape. The pang of sympathy <lb/>gives an energy to
          every office of <lb/>humanity: A certain mixture of <lb/>sadness adds a peculiar sweetness
          to <lb/>love, friendship, and all the tender <lb/>affections; which, even in raptures
          <lb/>of joy, are attended with the heav- <lb break="no"/>ing sigh, and the starting tear.
          The <lb/>action of heroic virtues lies in scenes <lb/>of distress—they wear deep mourn-
            <lb break="no"/>ing, and appear in majesty of woe; <lb/>and are, consequently, most
          admired <lb/>by such minds, as, with a noble for- <lb break="no"/>titude have a cast of
          tender solem- <lb break="no"/>nity:—For the preservation of <lb/>the body, a sensibility
          of pain is <lb/>spread over all its parts, which <lb/>quickly takes the alarm at the ap-
            <lb break="no"/>proach of ills: The necessary ap- <lb break="no"/>petites are also
          uneasy until mo- <lb break="no"/>derately gratified; as hunger and <lb/>thirst, desire of
          rest and sleep, &amp;c. <lb/>but this very uneasiness heightens <lb/>the
          gratifications.—In many cases, <lb/>the most important parts of the <cb/>
          <lb/>body, internal and external, have <lb/>the quickest and keenest sensibility of <lb/>a
          disorder, to prompt us the more to <lb/>remove it.—A moat in the eye leaves <lb/>us no
          rest—the smallest degree of a <lb/>tooth-ach is very painful; medicines <lb/>which, in
          their nature, are poisons, <lb/>are generally nauseous to the pa- <lb break="no"/>late;
          pleurisies, and the like distem- <lb break="no"/>pers, that attack the seat of life,
          <lb/>are agonizing. If these salutary <lb/>warnings were less urgent, they <lb/>would
          often be neglected in the <lb/>lap of ease, the hurry of business, <lb/>and the keen
          pursuit of wealth and <lb/>pleasure—as it is, they often are, <lb/>when unassisted by
          reason;—chil- <lb break="no"/>dren get their limbs frozen in their <lb/>frolics on the
          ice; misers pine with <lb/>want, among their immense stores; <lb/>and the mad voluptuary
          rushes into <lb/>loathsome tormenting, incurable <lb/>diseases. </p>
        <p> But all the senses and affections, <lb/>which are the immediate subjects of <lb/>pain,
          however useful or necessary <lb/>they may be in a certain degree, <lb/>must be restrained;
          when indulged, <lb/>they imbitter human life; as we <lb/>evidently see, by too many exam-
            <lb break="no"/>ples. A morose, choleric mind is <lb/>vexed with every trifle, and even
          <lb/>when no accidents ruffle it, becomes <lb/>as it were, choaked with its own <lb/>gall,
          and must vent it on some in- <lb break="no"/>nocent object. Timorous prudence <lb/>fills
          the heart with anxiety, and, by <lb/>habit, degenerates into a despondent
          <lb/>pusillanimity, which always fore- <lb break="no"/>bodes the worst;—for the ideas of
          <lb/>evil naturally lay hold of the mind, <lb/>and it is dangerous to view it with
          <lb/>too scrupulous attention.—How <lb/>many excellent female characters <lb/>distress
          themselves and their dearest <lb/>connections by a strange timidity <lb/>—they feel a
          presentiment of the <lb/>death of a child, from the
              <choice><sic>slighest</sic><corr>slightest</corr></choice>
          <lb/>ailment; and have no rest while <pb/>
          <lb/>their husbands are on a journey, <lb/>lest a tree should crush them, the <lb/>horses
          should start, and a hundred <lb/>very improbable accidents happen. <lb/>Many wealthy
          persons have lost <lb/>their reason from an improper ap- <lb break="no"/>prehension of
          want—and what <lb/>numbers are, every day, robbed, <lb/>cheated, plundered, in their own
          <lb/>imagination!—the coward dies a <lb/>thousand times; and every agoniz- <lb break="no"
          />ing death an affrighted fancy can <lb/>create:—Pleurisies, fevers, dropsy, <lb/>gout,
          flux, &amp;c. kill him in their <lb/>turn—he is gibetted, shipwrecked, <lb/>beheaded,
          drowned, burned, starved, <lb/>devoured by a shark, or bit by a <lb/>mad dog. Sadness,
          whether con- <lb break="no"/>stitutional or acquired, should be <lb/>prudently checked.
          Not to be hap- <lb break="no"/>py when we can, is folly; nay, a <lb/>crime against our
          great benefactor; <lb/>to brood over sorrows however real, <lb/>and to increase their
          bitterness, is <lb/>weakness. Let us confider that <lb/>every indulgence of grief impairs
          <lb/>the natural chearfulness of the soul, <lb/>and dread that greatest of evils, <emph
            style="font­-style: italic">a <lb/>broken heart</emph>, which cannot be heal- <lb
            break="no"/>ed by any medicine, nor the balm <lb/>of friendship—by no enjoyments in
          <lb/>this life, nor the blissful hope of <lb/>Heaven. </p>
        <p> A delicacy of constitution, that <cb/>
          <lb/>sinks under fatigue, melts in the <lb/>cheering ray, shivers with the re- <lb
            break="no"/>freshing breeze, and is quickly dis- <lb break="no"/>ordered by trivial
          external and in- <lb break="no"/>ternal accidents, is a severe misfor- <lb break="no"
          />tune, especially in some personal <lb/>and local circumstances. Every <lb/>means should
          then be devised to <lb/>harden the body, and fortify every <lb/>sense against the attacks
          of pain. <lb/>Much may certainly be done. Poor <lb/>children go barefoot, and half na- <lb
            break="no"/>ked in the dead of winter, yet grow <lb/>hardy as a pine knot; whereas the
          <lb/>darlings of the rich are too often <lb/>reared in such effeminacy, as if they
          <lb/>were to spend their lives in the nur- <lb break="no"/>sery. Eminent physicians have
          dis- <lb break="no"/>covered excellent expedients for <lb/>strengthening the inward parts,
          and <lb/>blunting the sensibility of pain—A <lb/>future day may behold improve- <lb
            break="no"/>ments, that at present appear im- <lb break="no"/>possible, if the great
          masters of the <lb/>healing art direct their inquiries to <lb/>this object, which is the
          greater, <lb/>as to prevent ill is much better than <lb/>to lessen or even remove it.

          oxen and <lb/>cows must very much depend on the <lb/>quality of their sires and dams; and,
          <lb/>that by a careful attention to the <lb/>subject, an improved breed may be

        <p> 2d. It is a generally received opi- <lb break="no"/>nion, that horses in a team travel
          <lb/>much faster than oxen;—yet some <lb/>European writers on husbandry, <lb/>mention many
          instances, in which it <lb/>appeared not only that oxen would <lb/>plough as much ground
          as an equal <lb/>number of horses; but travel also <lb/>as fast with a loaded carriage;
          par- <lb break="no"/>ticularly when, instead of yokes and <lb/>bows, they are geared in
          horse-har- <lb break="no"/>ness, with such variations as were <lb/>necessary to adapt it
          to their diffe- <lb break="no"/>rent shape. To ascertain the powers <lb/>of oxen, in these
          particulars, and <lb/>the expence of maintaining them, <lb/>the society deem matters of
          very <lb/>great moment; and are therefore <lb/>induced to offer a gold medal for <cb/>
          <lb/>the best set of experiments under- <lb break="no"/>taken with that view:--And, for
          <lb/>the next best, a silver medal.—In <lb/>relating these experiments, it will <lb/>be
          proper to describe the age and <lb/>size of the oxen, their plight, the <lb/>kinds and
          quantities of their food, <lb/>the times, manner, and expence of <lb/>shoeing them, in
          travelling; the <lb/>kinds of carriages used, and weights <lb/>of their loads; the seasons
          of the <lb/>year, and the length and quality of <lb/>the roads:—And in ploughing, <lb/>the
          size and fashion of the plough, <lb/>the quality of the soil, the depth <lb/>of the
          furrows, and the quantities <lb/>ploughed—and, in every operation <lb/>the time expended,
          and number and <lb/>sorts of hands employed in per- <lb break="no"/>forming it; with any
          other circum- <lb break="no"/>stances which may more fully elu- <lb break="no"/>cidate the
          subject. These experi- <lb break="no"/>ments will enable the essayist to de- <lb
            break="no"/>termine what will be the best form <lb/>and construction of yokes and bows
          <lb/>—and what of ox-harness, to en- <lb break="no"/>able oxen, with the best carriage of
          <lb/>their bodies and heads, the most <lb/>ease, and quickest step to draw the
          <lb/>heaviest loads; a description of <lb/>each of which sorts of gears, ex- <lb

        <p> EXPERIMENTS prove, that <lb/>wheat sown every way equi- <lb break="no"/>distant, yields
          the greatest crops; <lb/>and, that a number of grains drop- <lb break="no"/>ped close
          together, forming clus- <lb break="no"/>ters, are better than only one or <lb/>two grains
          to each cluster: But <lb/>what is the best distance and num- <lb break="no"/>ber of grains
          to be dropped toge- <lb break="no"/>ther, for forming clusters, are not <lb/>quite so well
          ascertained. In <placeName>Eu- <lb break="no"/>rope</placeName> it has been proved by
          experi- <lb break="no"/>ments, that the crop is increased in <lb/>proportion to the number
          of grains <lb/>sown for each cluster, as far as 15 <lb/>grains. Mr.
            <persName>Singleton's</persName> experi- <lb break="no"/>ment below, proves the like as
          far <lb/>as 13 grains; further he did not <lb/>try it: I proved it as far as 9 grains,
          <lb/>the extent of my trials. </p>
        <p> In <placeName>England</placeName>, seed wheat set at 4 <lb/>inches distance, every way,
          with one <lb/>grain for each cluster, proved better <lb/>than broad-cast, yet much
          inferior <lb/>to what was set at greater distances, <lb/>with more grains to a cluster.
          Ex- <lb break="no"/>periments made in <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, taught <lb/>me to
          prefer clusters at 6 inches by <lb/>6 inches apart, with 6 to 8 or 9 <lb/>grains (more
          grains were not tried <lb/>by me.) Mr. <persName>Singleton's</persName> experi- <cb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ment confirms these points. I should <lb/>also prefer placing the grains
          of <lb/>each cluster close together. Drop- <lb break="no"/>ped into holes made with a <seg

          <lb/>they were touched by each other; <lb/>yet these produced equal to what <lb/>were set
          near to the extremity of <lb/>circles of three inches diameter, the <lb/>centres of the
          circles being 8 inches <lb/>by 8 inches apart; when those <lb/>dropped into the dibbled
          holes were <lb/>only 6 inches by 6 inches apart, all <lb/>being set at the same time, in

        <p> Next to a high and perfect culti- <lb break="no"/>vation of ground, the quantity of
          <lb/>seed and method of sowing it, are <lb/>the most important for producing <lb/>line
          crops of wheat. Every one has <lb/>his manner (a thoughtless habit in <lb/>some) of
          sowing, and proportion of <lb/>seed; and every one thinks he pre- <lb break="no"/>pares
          his ground sufficiently, if not <lb/>better than his neighbour: But a <lb/>real, true, and
          proper proportion <lb/>is no where practised in this coun- <lb break="no"/>try. What is
          the best method of <lb/>sowing is too generally neglected to <lb/>be enquired into; and
          scarcely any <lb/>seek the knowledge of it thro' ex- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>periment—the only faithful instruc- <lb break="no"/>tor. It is wished that
          farmers would <lb/>try, in small, comparative experi- <lb break="no"/>ments, various
          proportions of seed <lb/>and methods of sowing, in small <lb/>pieces of ground, ploughed,

          as in the European, and my <lb/>experiments made in <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, that
          <lb/>produce, generally, is in proportion <lb/>to the nearness of the clusters, as
          <lb/>low as 6 inches by 6 inches; and <lb/>to the number of grains dropped <lb/>for each
          cluster, as high as thirteen <lb/>grains. Such part of Mr. <persName>Single- <lb

        <p> The deficiency in heads, of some <lb/>of the clusters, 6 inches by 6 inch- <lb
            break="no"/>es, is remarkable; and is in such <lb/>order as to convince us it must be
          <lb/>owing to some accident:—They <lb/>were the most exposed to the tur- <lb break="no"
          />kies, &amp;c. </p>
        <p> An acre sown 9 inches by 9 inch- <lb break="no"/>es, contains, 77,000 clusters; but
          <lb/>if sown 6 inches by 6 inches, it <lb/>would contain 174,000 clusters. If <lb/>then,
          the growth of the plants is <lb/>not lessened by their being too <cb/>
          <lb/>close, the produce, in the latter <lb/>case, must far exceed that of the <lb/>former;
          and although the branch- <lb break="no"/>ing should not be so great, yet the <lb/>crop
          must be greater; as appears <lb/>from the above instance; where the <lb/>produce of (heads
          equally full of <lb/>grain<choice><sic>(</sic><corr>)</corr></choice> is above a fourth
          more from <lb/>the cluster of 6 by 6 inches, than <lb/>from those of 9 by 9 inches, not-
            <lb break="no"/>withstanding their being reduced by <lb/>poultry so much more than the
          clus- <lb break="no"/>ters of 9 by 9 inches. </p>

          and a valley of <lb/>vanity and misfortune.—I cannot, <lb/>will not longer remain in

              >Poignard</term>: a small dagger.</note> and was ready to pierce <lb/>his heart, when
          suddenly his cave <lb/>flashed with lightnings—A being of <lb/>a beauty and stature more
          than hu- <lb break="no"/>man, clothed with a robe of celestial <lb/>azure, crowned with
          amaranths, and <lb/>waving a palm tree branch he held <lb/>in his right hand, stopped

          arm, and addressed him, say- <lb break="no"/>ing with a majestic smile, “Follow <lb/>me to

        <p> When they arrived there, “I <lb/>am <persName>Gabriel</persName>, the angel of peace,
          <lb/>said this respectable conductor to <lb/>him; turn thy eyes towards the <lb/>valley.”
            <persName>Maan Benzaid</persName> saw a de- <lb break="no"/>sert barren isle, overspread
          with <lb/>burning sands: In the midst of it <lb/>he perceived a meagre, pale, and
          <lb/>ghastly figure. It was a merchant, <lb/>who was perishing of hunger, and <lb/>was
          making dismal lamentations by <lb/>not finding herb, grain, or spring <lb/>of water in
          that desert; he was al- <lb break="no"/>so imploring the protection of hea- <lb break="no"
          />ven against the tygers, which were <lb/>ready to devour him. He held in <lb/>his hands a
          casket of jewels, which <lb/>he threw on the sand as useless to <lb/>him, and with great
          difficulty <lb/>crawled along towards an <seg xml:id="a056" corresp="#n056"

              >Eminence</term>: a lofty or elevated position.</note>
          <lb/>to which he every evening repaired, <lb/>to espy and give signals to the first
          <lb/>ship chance might direct to the <lb/>island. “Ye masters of the heavens, <lb/>said
            <persName>Maan Benzaid</persName>, do not permit <lb/>that distressed and forlorn wretch
          <lb/>to be devoured by wild beasts!”— <lb/>”Keep thy tongue silent,” said the <lb/>angel,
          “and observe.”—He look- <lb break="no"/>ed about him, and saw a ship put- <lb break="no"
          />ting in at this desert island. The <lb/>joy of the merchant, almost ready <lb/>to expire
          for want of food, was not <lb/>to be expressed, when the captain <lb/>offered to carry him
          to his country, <cb/>
          <lb/>if he would give him some reward. <lb/>The merchant offered him the half <lb/>of his
          jewels, and the captain, hav- <lb break="no"/>ing accepted it, held council with <lb/>his
          people to seize upon the rest, and <lb/>abandon him to his deplorable fate; <lb/>they did
          so, accordingly, and the <lb/>unfortunate merchant in vain strove <lb/>to move them to
          pity, by his sup- <lb break="no"/>plications and by his tears. </p>
        <p> “O Heaven! wilt thou permit <lb/>so atrocious an injustice,” cried <lb/><persName>Maan
            Benzaid</persName>! “Take notice,” <lb/>said the angel; “behold that ship, <lb/>into

          on which it has <lb/>just now struck; do not you hear <lb/>the lamentable cries of the

              <choice><orig>horrrid</orig><reg>horrid</reg></choice> desert by means <lb/>known only
          to himself. His heart <lb/>having been influenced and en- <lb break="no"/>grossed by
          avarice, he was not only <lb/>the most contemptible, but the most <lb/>unhappy of men. He
          imagined that <lb/>there was in riches some transcen- <lb break="no"/>dent charm, by the
          help of which <lb/>he should gratify all his desires, and <lb/>should never have any thing
          to fear. <lb/>This day he has not only began to <lb/>despise, but even to have riches in
          <lb/>horror, by scattering his jewels on <lb/>the sand, he has been sensible of <lb/>their
          inutility, and the behaviour <lb/>of the seamen has shewn him how <lb/>pernicious they may
          be; he is now <lb/>conscious to himself that they are <lb/>good or bad, useful or hurtful,
          ac- <lb break="no"/>cording to the temper of the pos- <lb break="no"/>sessor. Happy the

          if he <lb/>had lived longer.”—”And why,” <lb/>cried <persName>Maan Benzaid</persName>,

          en- <lb break="no"/>joy so much happiness and power?” <lb/>Wait a moment, replied the
          <lb/>inhabitant of the fifth heaven. <lb/><persName>Maan Benzaid</persName>, continuing to

            break="no"/>tomed to see an agreeable smile, <lb/>and the sprightly colours of health,
          <lb/>sometimes indicated the perturba- <lb break="no"/>tions of rage, and sometimes the
          <lb/>intoxications of drunkenness he had <lb/>indulged; he saw likewise painted <lb/>on
          it, disdain, terror, and all the <lb/>wretched symptoms of a debauch- <lb break="no"/>ed
          life; his hands were imbrued <lb/>in blood; his heart seemed rent <lb/>with the violence
          of rage; the pa- <cb/>
          <lb break="no"/>lace, where before sparkled all the <lb/>pomp of the east, was all of a
          sudden <lb/>changed into a dark dungeon: His <lb/>son lay extended on the ground,
          <lb/>bound, shackled, fettered, and his <lb/>eyes plucked out: soon after he <lb/>saw the
          favourite sultaness, whose <lb/>beauty he had so much admired, <lb/>present
            <persName>Kitchtab</persName> with a poisoned <lb/>cup, which she forced him to drink,
          <lb/>and he saw her directly after married <lb/>with his successor to the throne. </p>
        <p> “Happy,” said the angel of <lb/>peace,” is he, whom Providence <lb/>has delivered from a
          criminal state <lb/>by the angel of death, and from <lb/>whom Providence has taken a power
          <lb/>that would have brought upon him <lb/>the extremity of wretchedness!” </p>
        <p> “Enough, cried <persName>Maan Benzaid</persName>, <lb/>I adore the impenetrable designs
          of <lb/>the Almighty Power! From what <lb/>dreadful evils has not my son been
          <lb/>preserved by that death for which I <lb/>have cried so many tears! It is a <lb/>death
          of innocence and peace which <lb/>has left on the earth his memory <lb/>as a blessing, and
          has consigned his <lb/>soul over to an immortality of hap- <lb break="no"/>piness in
          heaven.” </p>
        <p> “Throw away the dagger,” <lb/>said the celestial messenger to him, <lb/>“with which thou

          occupations, their goodness <lb/>of heart, their officious attention to each <lb/>other,
          produced a mutual attachment: <lb/>They were fond of each other's com- <lb break="no"
          />pany; they waited with impatience for <lb/>the hour at which they usually met in
          <lb/>the meadow; they quitted it with re- <lb break="no"/>gret; because, when they were to
          leave <lb/>it, they were to separate. Their young <lb/>hearts were susceptible; they
          already <lb/>felt the passion of love, though they <lb/>were ignorant of its nature and
          its ten- <lb break="no"/>dency. Five years glided away in in- <lb break="no"/>nocent
          amusements; their sentiments <lb/>grew more animated and ardent; they <lb/>never met now
          without the warmest <lb/>emotions, which were heightened by <lb/>the artless expressions
          of their love. <lb/><persName>Lucetta</persName> frequently checked
            <persName>Perrin's</persName>
          <lb/>passion, not without regretting the con- <lb break="no"/>straint to which she was
          subjected by her <lb/>conscious and ingenuous modesty; <persName>Per- <lb break="no"
            />rin</persName> sighed, and imitated her cautious <lb/>behaviour. They both wished to
          be <lb/>united by wedlock, and communicated <lb/>to each other their mutual desire. Mar-
            <lb break="no"/>riage is the final object of rural love. <lb/>Seducement is not known in
          the inno- <lb break="no"/>cent village; the coquette and the man <lb/>of intrigue are
          characters not to be met <lb/>with there. <persName>Perrin</persName> intended to ask
            <persName>Lu- <cb/>
            <lb break="no"/>cetta</persName> of her father; he communicated <lb/>his intention to
          his mistress, who blush- <lb break="no"/>ed at the proposal, yet frankly acknow- <lb
            break="no"/>ledged that it gave her a very sensible <lb/>pleasure. She did not, however,
          choose <lb/>to be present at the interview betwixt <lb/>him and her father; she told her
          lover <lb/>that she was to go to the neighbouring <lb/>town the next day; she desired him
          to <lb/>avail himself of her absence, and to ac- <lb break="no"/>quaint her in the evening
          of his success. </p>
        <p> The young man, at the appointed <lb/>time flew to <persName>Lucetta's</persName> father.
          He open- <lb break="no"/>ed his mind to him without reserve. <lb/>Studied persuasion and
          art are not the <lb/>talents of rustic orators. He frankly <lb/>told him that he loved
            <persName>Lucetta</persName>.—You <lb/>love my daughter, answered the old <lb/>man
          abruptly!—You would marry her? <lb/>—Are you in earnest, <persName>Perrin</persName>?—How
          <lb/>do you propose to live? Have you clothes <lb/>to give her? Have you a roof to cover
          <lb/>her? Have you food to support her? <lb/>You are a servant; you have nothing.
            <lb/><persName>Lucetta</persName> is not rich enough to maintain <lb/>herself and you.
            <persName>Perrin</persName>, you are not <lb/>in a condition to keep a wife and fami-
            <lb break="no"/>ly. I have hands, replied <persName>Perrin</persName>; I <lb/>have
          health and strength; a man who <lb/>loves his wife never wants employment; <lb/>and what
          industry would I not exert <lb/>to maintain <persName>Lucetta</persName>! Hitherto I have
          <lb/>gained five crowns every year. I have <lb/>saved twenty; they will defray the ex- <lb
            break="no"/>pences of the wedding. I will work <lb/>more diligently; my savings will
          aug- <lb break="no"/>ment; I shall be able to take a little <lb/>farm; the richest
          inhabitants of our <lb/>village have begun as poorly as I shall <lb/>set off in life, why
          may I not succeed <lb/>as well as they? Very true, <persName>Perrin</persName>; <lb/>you
          are young; you may wait yet for <lb/>some time; when I find you a rich man, <lb/>my
          daughter is yours; but till then, <lb/>make me no more absurd and romantic <lb/>proposals. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Perrin</persName> could obtain no other answer; <lb/>he ran to meet
            <persName>Lucetta</persName>; he soon found <lb/>her; he was deeply affected with his <pb/>
          <lb/>disappointment; she read on his face <lb/>the tidings he was going to announce.
          <lb/>My father then has refused you!—Ah <lb/><persName>Lucetta</persName>, how unhappy I
          am to have <lb/>been born poor! But I have not lost <lb/>all hope; my situation may
          change: <lb/>Your husband would have spared no <lb/>pains to procure you a comfortable
          sub- <lb break="no"/>sistence; will not your lover do as <lb/>much to have the happiness
          of one day <lb/>possessing you? We shall yet be united; <lb/>I will not quit the
          delightful prospect. <lb/>I conjure you to keep your heart for <lb/>me; remember you have
          pledged it to <lb/>me.—Should your father propose a <lb/>match for
            you—<persName>Lucetta</persName>!—That is the <lb/>only misfortune I can fear: Your com-
            <lb break="no"/>pliance would terminate my life.—And <lb/>could I,
            <persName>Perrin</persName>, marry any one but <lb/>you? No? if I am not your wife, I
          <lb/>will be the wife of no other man upon <lb/>earth. </p>
        <p> They held this conversation on the <lb/>road to <placeName>Vitré</placeName>. Night
          advancing, oblig- <lb break="no"/>ed them to quicken their pace. The <lb/>evening was
          dark. <persName>Perrin's</persName> foot hits <lb/>against something in the road, and he
          <lb/>falls. He searches for what occasioned <lb/>his fall; he finds it; 'tis a heavy bag;
          <lb/>he takes it up; and, curious to know <lb/>what it contains, he goes with
            <persName>Lucetta</persName>
          <lb/>into a field where a fire, which the <lb/>peasants had lighted, in the day-time,
          <lb/>was yet burning. By the light of this <lb/>fire he opens the bag, and finds gold in
          <lb/>it.—What do I see? cried <persName>Lucetta</persName>. <lb/>Ah!
            <persName>Perrin</persName>, you are become rich!—Is <lb/>it possible, replied
            <persName>Perrin</persName>, that it is now <lb/>in my power to possess you? Can Hea-
            <lb break="no"/>ven have been so propitious to our love <lb/>as to bestow upon me what
          will pro- <lb break="no"/>cure your father's consent to our mar- <lb break="no"/>riage and
          make us happy! This idea <lb/>infuses joy into their souls. They view <lb/>the gold with
          eagerness, almost distrust- <lb break="no"/>ful of their eyes; sometimes they quit
          <lb/>the shining object, and look upon each <lb/>other with tenderness and transport.—
          <lb/>Their first surprise being abated, they <lb/>count the sum, it amounts to twelve
          <lb/>thousand livres. They are enchanted <lb/>with their immense treasure.—Ah,
            <persName>Lu- <lb break="no"/>cetta</persName>, cries <persName>Perrin</persName>, your
          father can no <lb/>longer oppose my happiness.—<persName>Lucetta</persName>
          <lb/>cannot find words to answer him; but <lb/>her eyes are animated and eloquent; <cb/>
          <lb/>she presses her lover's hand with rap- <lb break="no"/>ture.
            <persName>Perrin</persName> is now certain that his <lb/>bliss will soon be ratified: He
          embraces <lb/>his mistress with ardour and ecstasy? He <lb/>is absorbed in the idea of his
          approach- <lb break="no"/>ing felicity. Amiable <persName>Lucetta</persName>, cries he,
          <lb/>how dear is this fortune to me; for I <lb/>shall share it with you! </p>
        <p> They tie up their treasure, and pro- <lb break="no"/>ceed towards
            <persName>Lucetta's</persName> father's; for <lb/>they were determined to shew it imme-
            <lb break="no"/>diately to the old man. They were <lb/>now near his house, when on a
          sudden <lb/><persName>Perrin</persName> stopped.—By this gold, says he, <lb/>we must
          expect to be happy; but is it <lb/>ours? It undoubtedly belongs to a tra- <lb break="no"
          />veller: The fair of <placeName>Vitré</placeName> is just ended. <lb/>Some merchant has
          probably lost it in <lb/>his return home; at this very moment, <lb/>whilst we are giving
          up ourselves to joy, <lb/>he, perhaps, is a prey to despair.—Your <lb/>reflection is
          terrible, answered <persName>Lucetta</persName>; <lb/>the unhappy man, without doubt is in
          <lb/>the utmost distress; can we enjoy what <lb/>belongs to him? You make me trem- <lb
            break="no"/>ble.—We were carrying this money to <lb/>your father, replied
            <persName>Perrin</persName>; through its <lb/>influence, he would unquestionably
          <lb/>have consented to make us happy: But <lb/>could we have been happy in usurping
          <lb/>the property of another? Let us go to <lb/>the rector of our parish: he has always
          <lb/>shewn me great humanity; he recom- <lb break="no"/>mended me to the master whom I
          serve; <lb/>I should take no material step without <lb/>consulting him. </p>
        <p> The rector was at home. <persName>Perrin</persName>
          <lb/>gave him the bag which he had found. <lb/>He owned that he at first looked upon
          <lb/>it as a gift from Heaven; He acquaint- <lb break="no"/>ed him with his love of
            <persName>Lucetta</persName>, and <lb/>with the obstacle which his poverty had
          <lb/>proved to their union. The good man <lb/>was all attention to the story; he gave
          <lb/>them looks of paternal affection; their <lb/>behaviour awoke the sensibility of his
          <lb/>soul; he saw the ardour of a mutual <lb/>passion glisten in their eyes; he admired
          <lb/>their passion; but he more admired their <lb/>probity. He applauded their generous
          <lb/>conduct. <persName>Perrin</persName>, said he, cherish these <lb/>sentiments as long
          as you live. The <lb/>consciousness of them will make you <lb/>happy; and they will draw
          down from <lb/>Providence a blessing on your endea- <lb break="no"/>vours. We shall find
          the owner of this <pb/>
          <lb/>money; he will recompense your in- <lb break="no"/>tegrity; to his reward I will add
          a part <lb/>of the money I have saved; <persName>Lucetta</persName>
          <lb/>shall be yours; I will take upon me to <lb/>obtain her father's consent; you are
          <lb/>worthy of each other. If the money <lb/>which you have deposited with me, is <lb/>not
          reclaimed, it belongs to the poor; <lb/>you are poor; in restoring it to you, <lb/>I shall
          think that I act in obedience to <lb/>Providence, who, by your finding it, <lb/>and
          lodging it with me, has already <lb/>marked you out as an object of his <lb/>favour. </p>
        <p> The two lovers retired, satisfied with <lb/>having done their duty, and enlivened
          <lb/>with the hope of being yet united. The <lb/>bag was proclaimed in the rector's pa-
            <lb break="no"/>rish; advertisements of it were posted <lb/>up at
            <placeName>Vitré</placeName>, and all the neighbouring <lb/>villages. It was claimed by
          many ava- <lb break="no"/>ricious and selfish persons; but none of <lb/>them gave an
          accurate account of the <lb/>sum, the specie, and the bag which <lb/>contained it. </p>
        <p> In the mean time the rector did not <lb/>forget that he had promised to espouse
            <lb/><persName>Perrin's</persName> interest. He took a little farm <lb/>for him; he
          bought him cattle, and im- <lb break="no"/>plements of husbandry, and, two months
          <lb/>after, he married him to <persName>Lucetta</persName>. The <lb/>hearts of the
          fortunate couple, who had <lb/>now arrived at the summit of their <lb/>wishes, daily
          overflowed with gratitude <lb/>to Heaven, and to the rector. <persName>Perrin</persName>
          <lb/>was industrious—<persName>Lucetta</persName> was attentive <lb/>to her domestic
          affairs. They paid <lb/>their landlord with the most rigid punc- <lb break="no"/>tuality;
          they lived moderately on their <lb/>profits, and were happy. </p>
        <p> Two years expired, and the money <lb/>was not reclaimed by the owner. The <lb/>rector
          thought it superfluous to wait <lb/>any longer; he took, it to the virtuous <lb/>pair whom
          he had united. My chil- <lb break="no"/>dren, said he, enjoy the bounty of Pro- <lb
            break="no"/>vidence without abusing it: These twelve thousand <lb/>livres are dead with
          me; em- <lb break="no"/>ploy them to your honest advantage. If <lb/>you should discover
          the lawful owner of <lb/>them, you ought undoubtedly to re- <lb break="no"/>store them to
          him: Dispose of them in <lb/>such a way, that, though you change <lb/>their substance, you
          may retain their <lb/>value. <persName>Perrin</persName> followed his advice; he
          <lb/>resolved to purchase the farm which he <cb/>
          <lb/>rented. It was to be sold; it was esti- <lb break="no"/>mated at more than twelve
          thousand <lb/>livres: But for ready money <persName>Perrin</persName>
          <lb/>hoped to buy it for that sum. The <lb/>gold which he found he only looked <lb/>upon
          as a deposit; it could not, <lb/>he thought, be better secured: <lb/>And the rightful
          possessor, if ever <lb/>he should meet with him, could not be <lb/>a loser. </p>
        <p> The rector approved the project, and <lb/>the purchase was soon made. As
            <persName>Perrin</persName>
          <lb/>was now proprietor of the land which he <lb/>had farmed, he bestowed more pains in
          <lb/>the cultivation of it. His fields, kept in <lb/>better order, and more improved,
          yield- <lb break="no"/>ed a larger produce; he lived in that <lb/>ease and abundance which
          he had been <lb/>ambitious to obtain for <persName>Lucetta</persName>. Two <lb/>children
          successively blessed their union; <lb/>they rejoiced to see themselves renewed <lb/>in
          those tender pledges of their love. <lb/><persName>Perrin</persName>, in returning from
          the field, was <lb/>usually met by his wife, who presented <lb/>his children to him; he
          embraced them <lb/>with transport, and then clasped <persName>Lu- <lb break="no"
            />cetta</persName> in his arms. The children were <lb/>eagerly officious about their
          father: one <lb/>wiped the sweat from his face; the <lb/>other attempted to ease him of
          the <lb/>spade. He smiled at his feeble efforts; he <lb/>caressed him again, and thanked
          Heaven <lb/>for having given him an affectionate <lb/>wife, and children who resembled
          him. </p>
        <p> Some years after, the old rector died. <lb/><persName>Perrin</persName> and
            <persName>Lucetta</persName> lamented his death; <lb/>their minds dwelt afresh on what
          they <lb/>owed to his humanity; the reflection <lb/>made them contemplate their own situ-
            <lb break="no"/>ation. We, too, shall die, said they, <lb/>and we shall leave our farm
          to our chil- <lb break="no"/>dren. It is not our property. If he <lb/>to whom it belongs
          should return, he <lb/>would be deprived of it forever; we <lb/>shall take the right of
          another with us <lb/>to the grave. This idea they could <lb/>not support. Delicate in
          their inte- <lb break="no"/>grity, they could not be happy while <lb/>their consciences
          charged them with the <lb/>least appearance of fraud. They im- <lb break="no"/>mediately
          had a declaration drawn, and <lb/>signed by the principal inhabitants of <lb/>the village,
          which set forth the tenure <lb/>by which they held their farm. They <lb/>lodged the
          declaration in the hands of <lb/>the new rector. This precaution, which <pb/>
          <lb/>they thought necessary to enforce a re- <lb break="no"/>stitution that justice might
          exact of their <lb/>children, set their minds at ease. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Perrin</persName> had now been settled ten years <lb/>in this farm. One day,
          after a fore- <lb break="no"/>noon's hard labour, as he was going <lb/>home to dinner, he
          saw two men over- <lb break="no"/>turned in a <seg xml:id="a066" corresp="#n066"
            >chaise</seg><note xml:id="n066" corresp="#a066"><term style="font-style: italic"
              >Chaise</term>: a carriage.</note> on the high road, at <lb/>a small distance from his
          house. He <lb/>ran to their assistance; he offered them <lb/>his draught horses to convey
          their bag- <lb break="no"/>gage; he begged of them to go with <lb/>him, and accept such
          refreshment as his <lb/>humble roof afforded. The travellers <lb/>were not hurt by their
          fall. This is a <lb/>very unlucky place to me, said one of <lb/>them, I cannot pass it
          without some <lb/>misfortune. A great mischance befel <lb/>me here about twelve years ago:
          I was <lb/>returning from the fair of <placeName>Vitré</placeName>, and <lb/>near this
          spot I lost twelve thousand li- <lb break="no"/>vres in gold. But did you neglect, said
            <lb/><persName>Perrin</persName>, who heard him with attention, <lb/>to make proper
          enquiries for your mo- <lb break="no"/>ney? It was not in my power, replied <lb/>the
          stranger, to take the usual ways to <lb/>recover it. I was just going to make <lb/>a
          voyage to the <placeName>East Indies</placeName>; the vessel <lb/>in which I was to sail,
          would not have <lb/>waited for me; all the expedients I <lb/>could have fallen upon, to
          regain my <lb/>money, would undoubtedly have been <lb/>fruitless; and the delay which they
          <lb/>would have occasioned, would have <lb/>been more prejudicial to me than the <lb/>loss
          of it. </p>
        <p> This discourse made <persName>Perrin's</persName> heart <lb/>leap for joy: he repeated
          his invitation <lb/>with more earnestness; he entreated the <lb/>gentlemen to accept of
          the asylum which <lb/>he offered them; he assured them that <lb/>his house was the nearest
          and most com- <lb break="no"/>modious habitation of the place: They <lb/>complied with his
          request: he went of <lb/>the first, to shew them the way: He <lb/>soon met his wife, who,
              <choice><orig>acording</orig><reg>according</reg></choice> to <lb/>custom, came to
          meet him. He de- <lb break="no"/>sired her to hasten home, and prepare a <lb/>dinner for
          his guests. On their arrival <lb/>at his house, he brought them a refresh- <lb break="no"
          />ment, and renewed the conversation on <lb/>the loss of the twelve thousand livres.
          <lb/>By the sequel of the traveller's dis- <lb break="no"/>course, he was convinced that
          he was <lb/>the man to whom he owed a restitution. <cb/>
          <lb/>He went to the new rector, informed <lb/>him of what he had learned, and beg- <lb
            break="no"/>ged he would do him the favour to dine <lb/>with him. He accepted his
          invitation, <lb/>and accompanied him; admiring, as <lb/>he went, the joy of the peasant on
          a <lb/>discovery which would be his ruin. </p>
        <p> Dinner is served up—the travellers <lb/>are charmed with the hospitality of
            <persName>Per- <lb break="no"/>rin</persName>—they admire his domestic œcone- <lb
            break="no"/>my—the benevolence of his heart—the <lb/>frankness of his behaviour—the
          engag- <lb break="no"/>ing and ingenuous manner of <persName>Lucetta</persName>— <lb/>her
          assiduities, and her kindness—they <lb/>caress the children. After dinner <persName>Per-
              <lb break="no"/>rin</persName> shews them his house, his garden, <lb/>and his cattle;
          he informs them of the <lb/>situation, the fertility, and the produce <lb/>of his fields,
          all this, added he to the <lb/>traveller, on whose account he was so <lb/>particular,
          belongs to you. The mo- <lb break="no"/>ney which you lost, fell into my hands; <lb/>when
          I found that it was not likely to <lb/>be reclaimed, I bought this farm with <lb/>it,
              <choice><sic>whch </sic><corr>which</corr></choice> I always intended to give up
          <lb/>to him who should convince me that <lb/>he had a right to it—I now resign it <lb/>to
          you; if I had died without finding <lb/>you, the rector has a deed which con- <lb
            break="no"/>firms your property. </p>
        <p> The stranger was for some moments <lb/>lost in amazement—He read the writing <lb/>which
              <choice><sic>th erector</sic><corr>the rector</corr></choice> had put into his hand.
          <lb/>He looked earnestly on <persName>Perrin</persName>—on <persName>Lu- <lb break="no"
            />cetta</persName>, and their children. Where am <lb/>I, at length exclaimed he! and

          <lb/>hope you will give me the preference. <lb/>Your probity deserves a different re- <lb
            break="no"/>compence. It is now twelve years since <lb/>I lost the sum which you found:

          <lb/>prospered—it is long since I ceased to <lb/>feel the effects of my loss. Your resti-

          reclaimed it: What man <lb/>would have acted like you! </p>
        <p> He immediately tore the deed <lb/>which the rector had given him. <lb/>The world, said
          he, should be ac- <lb break="no"/>quainted with your generous ac- <lb break="no"/>tion. A
          deed to ratify my resigna- <lb break="no"/>tion in your favour, your right to <lb/>the

          <persName>CAPTAIN Ingoldsby</persName> was a <lb/>soldier of fortune; the younger <lb/>son
          of a younger branch of a great <lb/>and respectable family: but his <lb/>sword was his
          patrimony; and hav- <lb break="no"/>ing entered early into the profession <lb/>of arms for
          a maintenance, he pur- <lb break="no"/>sued it with that enthusiastic spirit <lb/>of
          honour, which is dictated by the <lb/>considerations of family pride, the <lb/>hope of
          fame, the dread of disgrace, <lb/>and the most ardent love of glory, <lb/>and of one’s
          country. </p>
        <p> He married, too, like a soldier: <lb/>interest made no part of his compo- <lb break="no"
          />sition. He saw and admired his <lb/><persName>Emma</persName>; he formed an acquaintance
          <lb/>with her; and found her mind the <lb/>counterpart of her person: young,
          <lb/>handsome, and gallant, he met with <lb/>no difficulty in inspiring mutual re- <lb

        <cb/>
        <p> Happiness is neither confined to <lb/>fortune or condition: the amiable <lb/>couple
          loved, and love supplied all <lb/>deficiencies. Love restrained the <lb/>gaiety of
            <persName>Mr. Ingoldsby</persName> disposi- <lb break="no"/>tion; and taught his amiable
          part- <lb break="no"/>ner the prudence necessary to regu- <lb break="no"/>late expences,
          which were to be <lb/>bounded by the pay of a <seg xml:id="a071" corresp="#n071"

        <p> Nor did the increase of their fa- <lb break="no"/>mily, (for heaven blessed them with

          rejoiced in the par- <lb break="no"/>ticipation of their scanty possessions, <lb/>to the

        <pb/>
        <p> In the care and superintendance of their <lb/>darling daughter, did their years roll on
          <lb/>in peaceable and humble content. If they <lb/>heaved a sigh, it was for their
            <persName>Miranda's</persName>
          <lb/>future welfare; if they breathed a wish, it <lb/>was to see her placed in a situation
          which <lb/>might guard her against the attacks of pover- <lb break="no"/>ty, and the
          designs of iniquity: from the <lb/>former, they were aware, beauty and ac- <lb break="no"
          />complishments would prove no shield; and <lb/>they trembled, when they reflected, that
          <lb/>they might prove the most powerful incite- <lb break="no"/>ments to the latter. </p>
        <p> The sweets of life are not to be enjoyed <lb/>without its accompanying embitterments.
          <lb/>These disquietudes were augmented by a cir- <lb break="no"/>cumstance as unexpected
          as it was alarming: <lb/>they were in a moment destined to be torn <lb/>from each other's
          arms; or to put chase a <lb/>continuance of the joys they had experienced <lb/>in sixteen
          years society, by incurring an ex- <lb break="no"/>pence they were unable to support, and
          <lb/>risquing dangers and difficulties, which fe- <lb break="no"/>male delicacy is little
          calculated to encoun- <lb break="no"/>ter. The regiment in which <persName>Mr.
            Ingoldsby</persName>
          <lb/>served, received orders to embark for <placeName>Ame- <lb break="no"
            />rica</placeName>, in transports already prepared for their <lb/>reception. </p>
        <p> On the communication of this intelli- <lb break="no"/>gence, so subversive of their
          little plans of <lb/>economy and felicity, <persName>Mrs. Ingoldsby</persName> ear- <lb
            break="no"/>nestly intreated, that she and her daughter <lb/>might be the companions of
          his voyage; she <lb/>enumerated, in the most lively and af- <lb break="no"/>fectionate
          terms, all the advantages that <lb/>might be derived from keeping their little <lb/>family
          together; and she displayed, in all <lb/>the eloquence of feeling grief, the horrors
          <lb/>that must await her and her daughter at the <lb/>moment of their separation. No
          arguments <lb/>were necessary to convince him that what <lb/>she wished must be right; he
          folded his <persName>Em- <lb break="no"/>ma</persName> and <persName>Miranda</persName> to
          his bosom; and whilst <lb/>he wept over the distresses to which all he <lb/>held dear
          might be exposed, a smile of ap- <lb break="no"/>probation burst thro’ the manly cloud,
          <lb/>and he exulted in such a wife, and such a <lb/>daughter. All the difficulties which
          the <lb/>narrowness of their finances suggested, were <lb/><seg xml:id="a073"

          embarkation, <lb/>left them no other anxiety than what con- <lb break="no"/>cerned a
          future provision for their <persName>Miranda</persName>. </p>
        <p> Few events, differing enough from the <lb/>common occurrences of life to be worth
          <lb/>recording, happened either in the course of <lb/>their voyage, or on their arrival at
            <placeName>Boston</placeName>; <lb/>except that the <seg xml:id="a074" corresp="#n074"

          />cer of another regiment, who accompanied <lb/>them in the same transport, seemed to have <cb/>
          <lb/>made some impression on the heart of the <lb/>gentle <persName>Miranda</persName>;
          who listened to tales of <lb/>love sanctioned by the approbation of her <lb/>parents, and
          sighed out her own confession <lb/>in strains of artless and irresistible harmony. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Mr. Monson</persName> was formed on the model <lb/>which <persName>Captain
            Ingoldsby</persName> had an idea fixed <lb/>on for the husband of his
            <persName>Miranda</persName>. His manners <lb/>were as mild as his soul was brave; he
          car- <lb break="no"/>ried command in one hand, and affection in <lb/>the other; and his
          orders were obeyed <lb/>with that mingled fear and love, with which <lb/>inferiors in
          every station look up to those <lb/>who neither exert their powers in tyranny, <lb/>nor
          suffer them to fall into contempt by im- <lb break="no"/>prudent and ill-timed indulgence.
          To the <lb/>qualifications of a soldier he added those <lb/>which most highly adorned
          private life; he <lb/>was lively, yet steady; generous, without <lb/>profusion; and, if
          his expences ever ex- <lb break="no"/>ceeded the strictest limits of prudence, the
          <lb/>excess might be attributed to some acts of <lb/>benevolence, to which his heart and
          his <lb/>purse were always equally open. Nor was <lb/>his income limited; for he was the
          only son <lb/>of a gentleman of fortune, who had indulged <kb/>his propensity to arms at
          the expence of the <lb/>most acute and agonizing sensations; and <lb/>who, with a parental
          affection as laudable as <lb/>it is uncommon, subjected him to no re- <lb break="no"
          />strictions but in the choice of a wife, and in <lb/>this grand object of the happiness
          of his <lb/>life, had only enjoined him to consider birth, <lb/>education, and virtue, as
          the most valuable <lb/>possessions she could bestow on him. </p>
        <p> But both <persName>Captain Ingoldsby</persName> and <persName>Mr. Mon- <lb break="no"
            />son</persName> were too regardful of decency and pro- <lb break="no"/>priety to hasten
          an event of so much im- <lb break="no"/>portance, till the father of the young gentle- <lb
            break="no"/>man had been acquainted with the attach- <lb break="no"/>ment: and letters
          from <persName>Mr. Ingoldsby</persName> and <lb/>the lover, were prepared to be dispatched
          <lb/>by the first ships which should sail for <placeName>Eu- <lb break="no"
            />rope</placeName>; and the young soldier conquered his <lb/>impatience, by the
          suggestions of conscious <lb/>dignity and rectitude in this discharge of <lb/>his filial
          duty. </p>
        <p> But, alas! these precautions were soon <lb/>rendered fruitless, by events which
          dissolved <lb/>the bands of affection; rent asunder the ties <lb/>of mutual love; darkened
          the fairest pros- <lb break="no"/>pects of future happiness; and <choice><sic>involved

          <lb/>with all the dignity of virtue, administer- <lb break="no"/>ing consolation to the

          rage, arraigning the <lb/>justice of Heaven, and the villainy of man! <lb/>And if they
          desire to revel in all the luxu- <lb break="no"/>ries of woe, let them attend to the

        <p> We shall not follow the unfortunate <lb/>mourners through the various progressions of
          <lb/>grief, from keen and piercing anguish, to <lb/>silent and corroding melancholy: In
          the <lb/>last state they embarked for <placeName>England</placeName>, after <lb/>having
          received every attention which the <lb/>governor and garrison could offer, as a tri- <lb
            break="no"/>bute to the memory of the deceased, and to <lb/>the virtues and excellencies
          of the survivors. </p>
        <p> On their arrival in <persName>England</persName>, their case be- <lb break="no"/>ing
          made known to their gracious and be- <lb break="no"/>nevolent sovereign, they were soon
          relieved <lb/>by his bounty from the apprehensions of in- <lb break="no"/>digence; and, on
          a pension granted to the <lb/>mother, and continued to the daughter in <lb/>case of her
          death, they retired to a village <lb/>very remote from the metropolis, and ren- <lb
            break="no"/>dered desirable to them by its being the re- <lb break="no"/>sidence of a
          maiden sister of <persName>Capt. In- <lb break="no"/>goldsby</persName>, who possessed a
          considerable por- <lb break="no"/>tion of the virtues of her brother, and an
          <lb/>affection for her niece, which could only be <lb/>exceeded by that of her mother. </p>
        <p> As the fortunes of this lady, though large <lb/>enough to gratify her wishes, were
          limited, <cb/>
          <lb/>she and the widow agreed to join their nar- <lb break="no"/>row incomes; and as
            <persName>Miranda</persName> was their mu- <lb break="no"/>tual care, so it was the
          earnest wish of the <lb/>aunt, that she might be accommodated at <lb/>their mutual
          expence; and they entered on <lb/>their little plan with the most affectionate
          <lb/>intentions of rendering it as agreeable and <lb/>comfortable to each other, as the
          nature of <lb/>a situation, in which they each felt, though <lb/>in different degrees, the
          pangs of softened <lb/>but unabated grief, would admit. </p>
        <p> But as no retirement will conceal the <lb/>charms of beauty, nor any circle, however
          <lb/>confined, prevent the fame of accomplish- <lb break="no"/>ments from spreading beyond
          its limit—<persName>Mr. <lb/>Maxwell</persName>, a neighbouring gentleman of for- <lb
            break="no"/>tune and character, was soon captivated with <lb/>the reports of
            <persName>Miranda's</persName> excellencies; and <lb/>as he was a widower, not much past
          the <lb/>prime of life; and had yet an inclination <lb/>again to wear the silken chains of
          matri- <lb break="no"/>mony, he determined to visit the fair; and <lb/>if he found her
          worthy of his heart, to offer <lb/>his hand; an offer, which he doubted not <lb/>would be
          accepted, as his person was far <lb/>from being disagreeable, his manners po- <lb
            break="no"/>lished and elegant, his character unexcep- <lb break="no"/>tionable, and his
          fortune very far above any <lb/>expectations which orphan indigence could <lb/>form. </p>
        <p> To a man of <persName>Mr. Maxwell's</persName> consequence, <lb/>few excuses were
          necessary for a liberty, <lb/>which, however improper among people of <lb/>equal fortunes,
          custom has unworthily com- <lb break="no"/>missioned the possessors of wealth to take
          <lb/>with those whose situations in life are less <lb/>eminently favored by the smiles of
          the blind <lb/>and undistinguishing goddess. </p>
        <p> But <persName>Mr. Maxwell</persName> was not of a dis- <lb break="no"/>position to avail
          himself of this unmerited <lb/>superiority; he languished for a proper in- <lb break="no"
          />troduction, and suffered all the pains of im- <lb break="no"/>patience, till accident
          threw in his way the <lb/>gratification of his wishes. The house which <lb/>the ladies
          inhabited was advertised for sale; <lb/>and, under pretence of an intention to pur- <lb
            break="no"/>chase, he obtained permission, in conse- <lb break="no"/>quence of a proper
          request, to inspect it on <lb/>a particular day, which at his instance had <lb/>been named
          by the fair tenants. </p>
        <p> On that day <persName>Mr. Maxwell</persName> hastened to the <lb/>village; and in the
          earliest moment that had <lb/>been mentioned, he alighted at <persName>Mrs. In- <lb
              break="no"/>goldsby's</persName> door, not without the most flat- <lb break="no"
          />tering expectations that the politeness of the <lb/>ladies would prove instrumental to
          the at- <lb break="no"/>tainment of the only object he had in view. </p>
        <p> Nor were his hopes disappointed. After <lb/>he had viewed the house and gardens with
          <lb/>the air of an intended purchaser, the refresh- <lb break="no"/>ment of tea was
          proposed to him, and be- <lb break="no"/>ing accepted without hesitation, he was in- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>troduced to the fair, the amiable, the still <lb/>mourning
            <persName>Miranda</persName>. </p>
        <p> Prepared by the universal voice to ad- <lb break="no"/>mire, love was the immediate
          consequence <lb/>of a visit, which he requested leave to re- <lb break="no"/>peat in terms
          with which civility could not <lb/>refuse to comply; and a very few days con- <lb
            break="no"/>firmed <persName>Mr. Maxwell</persName> the ardent and the pro- <lb
            break="no"/>fessed lover of <persName>Miranda</persName>. </p>
        <p> But her heart was still engaged, nor could <lb/>she abandon even an hopeless passion;
          she <lb/>wished to indulge her regrets through life, <lb/>and was averse to every
          proposition which <lb/>tended to turn the edge of her melancholy, <lb/>and most to those
          which offered a new ob- <lb break="no"/>ject for her affections. </p>
        <p> Yet the character, the fortune, the unob- <lb break="no"/>jectionable person of
            <persName>Mr. Maxwell</persName>, were <lb/>urged to her by her only friends, with such
          <lb/>energy, but mildness of persuasion, that en- <lb break="no"/>forced by the
          declarations of her admirer, <lb/>that he hoped not to inspire her with love, <lb/>but to
          engage her friendship; and an opi- <lb break="no"/>nion, that in accepting the hand of a
          man <lb/>advanced in years, she offered less violence <lb/>to her former engagement, than
          if she yield- <lb break="no"/>ed to the solicitations of a young and pleas- <lb break="no"
          />ing lover—she was prevailed on to promise <lb/><persName>Mr. Maxwell</persName> the
          accomplishment of his <lb/>wishes; and a day, at no very considerable <lb/>distance was
          named for the completion <lb/>of his happiness. </p>
        <p> The necessary preparations now engaged <lb/>the attention of <persName>Mr.
            Maxwell</persName>, and the two <lb/>matron ladies; whilst <persName>Miranda</persName>,
          like a sacri- <lb break="no"/>fice adorned with <seg xml:id="a077" corresp="#n077"

          ornaments of her person, <lb/>and the intended provisions of settlement <lb/>to be
          adjusted, without interfering in the <lb/>management, or participating in the result. </p>
        <p> But, a very few mornings before the ap- <lb break="no"/>pointed day, when the intended
          nuptials <lb/>were to take place, as <persName>Miranda</persName> was at break- <lb
            break="no"/>fast with her mother and aunt, a servant put <lb/>into her hands a letter,

          immediately delivered it to <persName>Mrs. <lb/>Ingoldsby</persName>, who, to the utter

            <p> THAT your heart is not at all interested <lb/>in the intended event, you have, with

              <lb/>with unalterable regard, so I think it my <lb/>duty to explain to you the motives
              by which <lb/>I am influenced; in a conduct which, how- <lb break="no"/>ever
              censurable it may appear in the public <lb/>eye, will, I am persuaded, find a full
              justi- <lb break="no"/>fication in your goodness of heart, and in <lb/>the sensibility

            <p> My long lost son! my son, whom I had <lb/>for years resigned to Heaven, is restored
              to <lb/>me—and Providence, which has bestowed <lb/>on me this consummate happiness,
              will not <lb/>permit me to add to it a wish which con- <lb break="no"/>cerns myself. </p>
            <p> But I have another explanation to make, <lb/>in which I am to bespeak your
              forgiveness <lb/>for an imposition, which, however inno- <lb break="no"/>cent with
              respect to myself, I must confess <lb/>to have been rather improper with regard to
              <lb/>you. My real name is not <persName>Maxwell</persName>, which <lb/>I assumed upon
              the supposed death of my <lb/>son, when I retired from my usual place of
              <lb/>residence, in a distant part of the kingdom, <lb/>to avoid the importunities of
              some worth- <lb break="no"/>less and disagreeable relations; and this se- <lb
                break="no"/>cret I entrusted to only one friend in the <lb/>metropolis, from whom my
              son procured <lb/>directions to his concealed and almost for- <lb break="no"/>gotten
              father. </p>
            <p> It is at the particular instance of this son, <lb/>that I take the liberty to
              enclose an order <lb/>on my banker for three thousand pounds, <lb/>which I entreat you
              to accept as a small <lb/>tribute of my gratitude, for your intended <lb/>goodness to
              him, who, till he has the ho- <lb break="no"/>nour to disclose to you in person his
              real <lb/>name, begs leave to subscribe himself, </p>

            </p>
            <p> P. S. Let me entreat you to suffer me to <lb/>introduce my son to you in the course

        <p> Before the three ladies could recover from <lb/>the surprise which this extraordinary
          epistle <lb/>had occasioned, the arrival of <persName>Mr. Maxwell</persName>
          <lb/>and another gentleman was announced, and, <lb/>as the former entered the room, he
          presented <lb/>his son to <persName>Miranda</persName>; who, having uttered <lb/>the
          words, ‘My Monson!’ fell motionless <lb/>into the arms of his father. </p>
        <p> The conclusion of the story is obvious. <lb/>He who held the welfare of his son in
          higher <lb/>estimation than his own happiness, could <lb/>have no objection to a match
          which Heaven <lb/>itself had ordained; and where worth, ho- <lb break="no"/>nour, beauty,

              <l>How much to company you were inclin’d, </l>
              <l>If I had things to entertain genteel; </l>

              <l>I’d be as fond of company as you.— </l>
              <l>And oft a richer service bribes the feast, </l>
              <l>Than suits his purse, and makes himself a jest; </l>
              <l>And tho’ the good man gains his point at last, </l>
              <l>It damps convivial mirth, and poisons the repast. </l>
              <l>But you, my dear— if you would wish to shine,</l>
              <l>Must always say,—your friends are also mine: </l>
              <l>The house is your’s, and I will do the best, </l>
              <l>To give a cheerful welcome to each guest. <lb/>Nor are those maxims difficult to
                cope </l>
              <l>When stimulated by so fair a hope, </l>
              <pb/>
              <l>To reach the summit of domestic bliss; </l>
              <l>And crown each day with ever smiling peace. <lb/>Now if these lines one caution
                should contain, </l>
              <l>To gain that end, my labour’s not in vain; </l>
              <l>And be assur’d, my dear, while life endures </l>

          <note xml:id="n110" corresp="#a110">The <bibl>“Intelligence”</bibl> section of the <bibl
              style="font­-style: italic">Columbian Magazine</bibl> is fairly typical of the
            reprinting practices of late eighteenth century periodicals. These brief clippings
            (often reprinted verbatim from other sources) are intended to highlight stories that
            were considered to be of lasting importance to the magazine’s readers. The collection
            gathered in this issue is, perhaps, particularly telling for how it highlights the
            instabilities of the late eighteenth-century Atlantic world. On the international front,
            the reports of the death of the King of <placeName>Prussia</placeName>, the potential of
            civil insurrection in <placeName>the Netherlands</placeName>, the deployment of more
            Spanish warships to <placeName>South America</placeName> and the <placeName>Pacific
              Ocean</placeName>, and the muted references to Algerian piracy in <placeName>the
              Mediterranean</placeName>, evince the uncertainties of circum-Atlantic mobility and
            trade in the era. The lengthy attention to violent encounters between U.S. settlers and
            Native Americans along the western frontier highlights the tensions surrounding early
            efforts of <placeName>U.S.</placeName> based settler colonialism; similarly, the stories
            about Nova Scotian refugees, the British refusal to decamp from forts in
              <placeName>upstate New York</placeName>, paper currency, and the Shays Rebellion in
              <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, all point to domestic unrest, civil and economic
            turmoil, and the porousness of national borders. Perhaps the most optimistic report in
            this issue is the news that “<quote>that the nail manufactory is brought to such
              perfection throughout the <placeName>United States</placeName></quote>” that a
            reliance on the importation of foreign manufactured items might no longer be necessary.
            Given the instabilities contained in the surrounding stories, this sense of optimism
            concerning domestic manufacturing is perhaps less surprising than it might at first
            seem. In order to demonstrate just how widespread the practice of reprinting news
            reports was in eighteenth century U.S. periodicals we offer the following (far from
            exhaustive) brief catalog. Verbatim reports of the death of the King of

        <p> “Our tawny brethren are like to be very <lb/>troublesome; they have killed several peo-
            <lb break="no"/>ple lately; the last a boy, about twelve miles <lb/>below
            <placeName>Wheelen</placeName>, on the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> side of
            <placeName>the <lb/>Ohio</placeName>; they took another boy and four <lb/>horses, but
          being pursued by the inhabitants, <lb/>four of them mounted the horses and swam <lb/>the
          river, the remaining three, with the boy, <lb/>got into a canoe, when the pursuers came to
          <lb/>the banks of the river and fortunately killed <lb/>the three Indians and retook the
          boy, whom <lb/>the Indians had wounded in the arm. All <lb/>the settlers on the south side
          of <placeName>the Ohio</placeName> be- <lb break="no"/>low <placeName>Wheelen</placeName>,
          a distance of forty miles, have <lb/>fled to that place, and stockaded themselves.
          <lb/>The people opposite to us are much alarmed <lb/>and talk of withdrawing to the more
          settled <lb/>parts of the country. It is really distressing <lb/>to think how these poor
          people have suf- <lb break="no"/>fered, and are likely to suffer, unless the Sa- <lb
            break="no"/>vages are brought to peacable terms, to ac- <lb break="no"/>complish which,
          Congress must adopt vi- <lb break="no"/>gorous and proper measures, and trust no

              merchant vessels in the <placeName>Mediterranean Sea</placeName> in the late
              eighteenth century. Since the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> had no standing navy (until

              merchant ships and since the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> refused to pay tribute to the
              so-called “Barbary pirates,” U.S. ships were often seized by Algerian privateers.
              These privateers impressed and enslaved American sailors, and ransomed the ships
              cargoes. This situation culminated in the Barbary Wars of the early nineteenth
              century.</note> Indeed no Algerine <lb/>cruiser has been seen on this coast this year,

        <p> This day the two following resolves were <lb/>agreed to by this state, on motion of

        <p> “<quote>Whereas it is the duty of the freemen <lb/>of this commonwealth, to apportion

            “<quote>The <lb/>troops under the command of <persName>General <pb/>
              <lb/>Clarke</persName> returned the <date when="1786-10-15">15th instant</date>, and I
            am <lb/>informed the greatest disorder prevailed <lb/>among them from the time they
            marched <lb/>from <placeName>Clarkesville</placeName>; some of the officers were
            <lb/>arrested and broke by a court martial on their <lb/>march to <placeName>Post St.
              Vincent’s</placeName>, which occa- <lb break="no"/>sioned an uneasiness among the
            soldiers, but <lb/>was made easy in some measure by the Ge- <lb break="no"/>neral’s
            re-instating them again to their for- <lb break="no"/>mer commands: Thus they arrived at
              <placeName>Post <lb/>St. Vincents</placeName>, where they made prisoners, <lb/>42
            Indians, who were with the French and <lb/>Americans at that place, in a friendly man-
              <lb break="no"/>ner; they were kept in confinement but a <lb/>short time before they
            were set at liberty; <lb/>and enlisted 300 men from the Post with <lb/>him, and
            appointed officers to command <lb/>them, to keep garrison at <placeName>Post St.
              Vincents</placeName>
            <lb/>for one year; this business detained them ten <lb/>days. In this time the soldiers
            began to be <lb/>very uneasy, and wished to return home; <lb/>however the General
            prevailed with them <lb/>to march from that place towards the prin- <lb break="no"
            />cipal towns on the <placeName>Wabash River</placeName>, assuring <lb/>them, the
            business which they came on could <lb/>be effected in a few
                days<choice><sic>,</sic><corr>.</corr></choice> On the third <lb/>day’s march
            towards the towns, about 200 <lb/>of the men were very clamorous, and in the
            <lb/>afternoon refused to march any further: On <lb/>the first information the General
            received of <lb/>it, he ordered a halt, and in the most press- <lb break="no"/>ing
            manner, begged them only to march <lb/>with him three days more; in which time, <lb/>he
            had reason to believe, the Indians would <lb/>either be received in a hostile manner, or
            <lb/>they would make application for peace: No <lb/>argument the General could make use
            of had <lb/>any effect with them: The General thought <lb/>it most adviseable to collect
            his officers in <lb/>council when it was agreed upon to return, <lb/>and they
            accordingly set off. The General <lb/>himself staid at <placeName>Post St.
              Vincents</placeName>, with a <lb/>view of holding a treaty with the Indians,
            <lb/>provided they were inclined for it.</quote>
        </p>
        <p> “<quote><persName>Colonel Logan</persName> marched from the <placeName>Mouth <lb/>of
              Limestone</placeName> about the 1st instant, with 800 <lb/>men, (600 of whom were on
            horseback) <lb/>against the Shawanese towns on the Head of <lb/>the Miami, and had it
            not been for a de- <lb break="no"/>serter that got in and informed the Indians <lb/>of
            their approach, in all probability the <lb/>whole army would have been in their towns
            <lb/>before they had known any thing of their <lb/>coming. It appears that before the
            deserter <lb/>had got in, most of the warriors had gone <lb/>out in order to meet
              <persName>General Clarke</persName>, not <lb/>knowing of any other party marching
            against <lb/>them; so that by the time <persName>Colonel Logan</persName>
            <lb/>appeared in sight, most of the Indians had <lb/>left the towns. They made prisoners
            32 <lb/>women and children, and killed 11 men, <lb/>among them was their chief,
              <persName>King Melantha</persName>, <lb/>who gave himself up without any resistance, <cb/>
            <lb/>with his wife and children, and afterwards <lb/>was murdered by a <persName>Colonel
              M’Gary</persName>. They <lb/>burnt 10 towns and villages and all their <lb/>corn;
            brought off several horses and a quan- <lb break="no"/>tity of plunder. The squaws and
            children <lb/>prisoners arrived here the 21st instant, where <lb/>I expect they will
            continue until exchanged.</quote>” </p>
