            	<p>
            		THERE are but two degrees 
            		<lb/>in the characters of mankind, that seem to 
            		<lb/>arrest the attention of the public. The 
            		<lb/>first is that of him, who is the most distin-
            		<lb break="no"/>guished in laudable and virtuous achieve-
            		<lb break="no"/>ments, or in the promotion of general good. 
            		<lb/>The second, that of him, who has arrived to 
            		<lb/>the greatest pitch in vice and wickedness.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		NOTWITHSTANDING these characters 
            		<lb/>exhibit the greatest contrast among man-
            		<lb break="no"/>kind, it is not doubted but each, judicious-
            		<lb break="no"/>ly and properly managed, may render es-
            		<lb break="no"/>sential service. Whilst the former ever 
            		<lb/>demands our love and imitation, the other 
            		<lb/>should serve to fortify our minds against 
            		<lb/>its own attacks—exciting only our pity 
            		<lb/>and detestation. This is the only method, 
            		<lb/>perhaps, by which good may be said to 
            		<lb/>come out of evil.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		MY first business, then, with the public,
            		<lb/>is to inform them, that the FEMALE, who 
            		<pb/>
            		<lb/>is the subject of the following MEMOIRS, 
            		<lb/>does not only exist in theory and imagin-
            		<lb break="no"/>ation, but in reality. And were she not 
            		<lb/>already known to the public, I might take 
            		<lb/>pride in being the first to divulge—a <head style="font-style:italic">distin-

            	    <lb/>birth; <seg xml:id="a002" corresp="#n002">and I should estimate her natural <emph style="font-style: italic">source</emph> too 
            	        <lb/>meanly,</seg><note xml:id="n002" corresp="#a002">This sentence originally reads “<quote>I estimate her natural source too highly to presume. . .</quote>” and is corrected per the errata listed at the end of the original edition.</note>
            	    
            	    to presume she is dishonoured in 
            		<lb/>the acknowledgement of such an offspring.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		HOWEVER erroneous this idea may be 
            		<lb/>deemed, I shall here state only two gener-
            		<lb break="no"/>al traits in her life to corroborate its truth. 
            		<lb/>The criterion will still remain to be formed 
            		<lb/>by a candid and impartial public.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		SHE was born and educated in humble 
            		<lb/>obscurity—distinguished, during her mi-
            		<lb break="no"/>nority, only by <emph style="font-style: italic">unusual</emph> propensities for lear-
            		<lb break="no"/>ning, and <emph style="font-style: italic">few</emph> opportunities to obtain the 
            		<lb/>inestimable prize. At the age of eighteen 
            		<lb/>she stepped forward upon a more exalted 
            		<lb/>stage of action. She found <persName>Columbia</persName>, her 
            		<lb/>common parent, enveloped and distracted 
            		<lb/>with confusion, anguish and war. She com-
            		<pb/>
            		<lb break="no"/>miserated, as well as participated, her suf-
            		<lb break="no"/>ferings. And as a proof of her fidelity and 
            	    <lb/><seg xml:id="a003" corresp="#n003">filial attachment,</seg><note xml:id="n003" corresp="#a003"><term style="font-style: italic">Filial attachment</term>: the faithfulness of a child to a parent.</note> she voluntarily offered her 
            	    <lb/>services in the character of a <seg xml:id="a004" corresp="#n004"><emph style="font-style: italic">Continental 
            	        <lb/>Soldier</emph>,</seg><note xml:id="n004" corresp="#a004"><term style="font-style: italic">Continental Soldier</term>: a solider of the Continental Army, as distinct from a soldier in a state militia.</note> in defence of her <emph style="font-style: italic">cause;</emph> by which, 
            		<lb/>she seemed resolved to rescue the rest of 
            		<lb/>her brothers and sisters from that flagrant 
            		<lb/>destruction, which, every instant, seemed 
            		<lb/>ready to bury them in one general ruin; 
            		<lb/>or, to perish, a noble sacrifice, in the at-
            		<lb break="no"/>tempt.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		HAVING noted the leading traits of this 
            		<lb/>illustrious <term style="font-style: italic">Fair</term>, I hasten to give a concise 
            		<lb/>account of the design and execution of the 
            		<lb/>work.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		JUSTICE, in the first place, demands that 
            		<lb/>I should mention the reluctance, with 
            		<lb/>which she has consented to the publica-
            		<lb break="no"/>tion of this <term style="font-style: italic">Review</term> of her life. Though it 
            		<lb/>has become more fashionable, in these days 
            		<lb/>of liberty and liberality, to publish the 
            		<lb/>lives of illustrious persons; yet she refus-
            		<lb break="no"/>ed the solicitations of a number of literary 
            		<pb/>
            		<lb/>characters to publish her own, till after her 
            		<lb/>exit. She is not a stickler for tradition; 
            		<lb/>yet this is against her.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		ABOUT sixteen months ago, by desire 
            		<lb/>of a friend, I made her a visit for this pur-
            		<lb break="no"/>pose. She did not, positively, discard my 
            		<lb/>request. Being indisposed, she said, should 
            		<lb/>she recover, if I would again be at the 
            		<lb/>trouble to call on her, she would in the in-
            		<lb break="no"/>terim take advice, consult matters with 
            		<lb/>herself, and come to a final decision. This 
            		<lb/>was the first of my acquaintance with her.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		IN a few weeks, I again waited on her. 
            		<lb/>Having critically weighed her own feel-
            		<lb break="no"/>ings, and wishing to gratify the curiosity of 
            		<lb/>many, of whom she had taken advice—
            		<lb/>with extreme <emph style="font-style: italic">modesty</emph> and trembling <emph style="font-style: italic">diffidence</emph>, 
            	    <lb/>she consented to take a public <seg xml:id="a005" corresp="#n005"><term style="font-style: italic">Review</term></seg><note xml:id="n005" corresp="#a005"><term style="font-style: italic">Review</term>: <persName>Mann</persName> seems to play with multiple meanings of review here—looking over something again, but also a formal military display for inspection.</note> of 
            		<lb/>the most material circumstances and events 
            		<lb/>of her life. She relies on that candor and 
            		<lb/>impartiality from the public that now at-
            		<lb break="no"/>tend the detail of her MEMOIRS.
            	</p>
            	<pb/>
            	<p>
            		I INTENDED to have executed this work 
            		<lb/>at leisure; as indeed, I have. I had no 
            		<lb/>other way; as the materials were mostly 
            		<lb/>to be collected. This, with other pressing 
            		<lb/>avocations in life, brings me under the ne-
            		<lb break="no"/>cessity to apologize to my worthy <term style="font-style: italic">Patrons</term>, 
            		<lb/>for the delay of its publication a few weeks 
            		<lb/>longer than the intended time.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		SENSIBLY impressed with the idea, that 
            		<lb/>every subject intended for public contem-
            		<lb break="no"/>plation, should be managed with intentions 
            		<lb/>to promote general good; I have, in eve-
            	    <lb break="no"/>ry instance, in the <bibl>FEMALE REVIEW</bibl>, <seg xml:id="a006" corresp="#n006">in-
            	        <lb break="no"/>defatigably,</seg><note xml:id="n006" corresp="#a006"><term style="font-style: italic">Indefatigably</term>: untiringly.</note> labored for this important end. 
            		<lb/>But perhaps I differ from most biographers 
            		<lb/>in this respect. I have taken liberty to in-
            		<lb break="no"/>tersperse, through the whole, a series of 
            		<lb/>moral reflections, and have attempted some 
            		<lb/>literary and historical information. How-
            		<lb break="no"/>ever singular this is, I have the vanity 
            		<lb/>to think it will not be deemed useless.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		AS an impartial writer, I am bound to 
            		<lb/>handle these MEMOIRS in a disinterested 
            		<pb/>
            		<lb/>manner. But where a total sacrifice of 
            		<lb/>truth does not forbid, I take pride in pub-
            		<lb break="no"/>licly avowing, in this place, my desire (as 
            		<lb/>every one ought) to extol <term style="font-style: italic">virtue</term>, rather 
            		<lb/>than give the least countenance to <term style="font-style: italic">vice</term> un-
            		<lb break="no"/>der any name, pretext or sanction. Both 
            		<lb/>may be represented and discussed—<term style="font-style: italic">Vice</term> ex-
            		<lb break="no"/>posed—Virtue cherished, revered and ex-
            		<lb break="no"/>tolled.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		THE authorities, upon which I have ven-
            		<lb break="no"/>tured, for the support of <term style="font-style: italic">facts</term> related in the 
            		<lb/>following MEMOIRS, are not merely the

            		IT would be almost incredibly strange, 
            		<lb/>should no idle, capricious and even calum-
            		<lb break="no"/>nious tale take rise with respect to the <emph style="font-style: italic">repu-
            			<lb break="no"/>tation</emph> of the female, distinguished as she is, 
            		<lb/>who is the subject of these sheets. Being 
            		<pb/>
            		<lb/>aware of this, she has already anticipated, 
            		<lb/>and perhaps, in some measure experienced 
            		<lb/>it. Her precaution now is, to prepare for 
            		<lb/>the worst. She dreads no censure—no 
            		<lb/>lash of aspersion more than that of the ju-
            		<lb break="no"/>dicious and virtuous. My own wishes are 
            		<lb/>in this respect, as in all others, that truth, 
            		<lb/>candor and charity may be our ruling 
            		<lb/>principles. When we seriously consider

            		<lb/>it be found that decorum and propriety of 
            		<lb/>conduct predominated in her general pur-
            	    <lb break="no"/>suits, we may bear to <seg xml:id="a007" corresp="#n007">palliate</seg><note xml:id="n007" corresp="#a007"><term style="font-style: italic">Palliate</term>: to cloak or overlook.</note> a few foibles,

            		<lb/>I have, decidedly, declared my choice for

            		<lb/>suffer the lash of aspersion from either sex 
            		<lb/>for having shown partiality, I shall rejoice

            	</p>
            	<p>
            		I CANNOT disapprove their vehement at-
            		<lb break="no"/>tachment to many novels—even to the 
            		<lb/>productions of our own soil. Whilst they 
            		<lb/>touch the passions with all that is captivat-
            		<lb break="no"/>ing and agreeable, they inspire manly 
            		<lb/>thoughts, and irresistibly gain our assent to 
            		<lb/>virtue. As the peculiar events, that have 
            		<lb/>given rise to the <bibl>FEMALE REVIEW</bibl>, stand 
            		<lb/>without a rival in American annals; I, al-
            		<lb break="no"/>so, hope my endeavours to render it agree-
            		<lb break="no"/>ably entertaining and useful to them may

            		<lb break="no"/>ly yield the palm of style to the rapturous 
            		<lb/>and melting expressions of the novelist:

        			HER grand-father, <persName>ELISHA BRADFORD</persName>, 
        			<lb/>was a native of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> in <placeName>New-England</placeName>. 
        			<lb/>He possessed good abilities, and explored 
        			<lb/>many sources, that led him to literary dis-
        			<lb break="no"/>tinction. As he was eminent in proper-
        			<lb break="no"/>ty; so piety, humanity and uprightness 
        			<lb/>were the distinguishing characteristics of 
        			<lb/>his life. He was married, <date when="1719-09-07">September 7, 
        				<lb/>1719</date>, to <persName>BATHSHEBA LE BROCHE</persName>, a 
        			<lb/>French lady of elegant extraction and ac-
        			<lb break="no"/>complishments. Her father was a native 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>of <placeName>Paris</placeName>. He left a large issue; of which, 
        			<lb/><persName>Miss SAMPSON’s</persName> mother is one.—But <persName>Mr. 
        				<lb/>BRADFORD</persName>, for one of his benevolent of-
        			<lb break="no"/>fices, being bound for a ship and rich car-
        			<lb break="no"/>go belonging to a merchant of the same 
        			<lb/>town, had the misfortune to lose the great-
        			<lb break="no"/>er part of his interest. Thus deprived, at 
        			<lb/>once, of what he had learned to prize by 
        			<lb/>the industry and economy it cost him; it 
        			<lb/>is natural to suppose, it was no small dis-
        			<lb break="no"/>couragement to him, and that the face of 
        			<lb/>things wore a different aspect around him: 
        			<lb/>especially, when we reflect, that the fulfil-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment of those principles, which exert them-
        			<lb break="no"/>selves in acts of benevolence and affection 
        			<lb/>towards all persons, depend, greatly, on 
        			<lb/>wealth. Being at this time considerably 
        			<lb/>advanced in years, this circumstance, to-
        			<lb break="no"/>gether with the loss of his eldest son, preyed 
        			<lb/>fast upon his constitution: And he did not 
        			<lb/>long survive to mourn the loss of what 
        			<lb/>seemed not in his power to remedy.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			<persName>MISS SAMPSON’s</persName> parents, though en-
        			<lb break="no"/>dowed with good abilities, cannot in an 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>eminent degree, be distinguished either 
        			<lb/>by fortune or scientific acquisition. Her 
        			<lb/>father was an only son, and heir to no in-
        			<lb break="no"/>considerable estate. And if it be asked, 
        			<lb/>why her parents had not a more liberal ed-
        			<lb break="no"/>ucation? the answer may be a general ob-
        		    <lb break="no"/>jection:—Different persons are <seg xml:id="a014" corresp="#n014">actuated</seg><note xml:id="n014" corresp="#a014"><term style="font-style: italic">Actuated</term>: motivated.</note> 
        			<lb/>by different objects of pursuit. Some, it 
        			<lb/>is evident, have leading propensities for 
        			<lb/>the accumulation of lucrative gain: whilst 
        			<lb/>others, who possess it, gladly embrace the 
        			<lb/>opportunity for their advancement in lit-
        			<lb break="no"/>erature.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IT was, doubtless, the intention of <persName>Mr. 
        				<lb/>BRADFORD</persName> to have given his children good 
        			<lb/>education. But whether the wreck in his 
        			<lb/>fortune, or whether his numerous progeny 
        			<lb/>restrained the liberality of his bestowments 
        			<lb/>in this respect, I pretend not to affirm. It 
        			<lb/>is, however, more than probable, that her 
        			<lb/>mother’s, and perhaps her father’s, educa-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion, in some respects, was superior to that 
        			<lb/>of the commonalty.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			IT is no dishonorable trait in the char-
        			<lb break="no"/>acter of any in <placeName>America</placeName> to be born <emph style="font-style: italic">farmers</emph>; 
        			<lb/>even if they pursue the occupation through 
        			<lb/>life. Their aim, however, must be to fur-
        			<lb break="no"/>nish themselves with the requisites, which 
        			<lb/>will render them useful and happy, and 
        			<lb/>those who are round about them. Had 
        			<lb/>the latter of these blessings been conferr-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed on <persName>Miss SAMPSON’s</persName> father, he might, 
        			<lb/>peradventure, have surmounted difficulties, 
        			<lb/>which, it is thought, tended to make him 
        			<lb/>fickle, and perhaps, too loose in his morals. 
        			<lb/>He met with a sad disappointment in his 
        			<lb/>father’s estate, occasioned by the ill de-
        			<lb break="no"/>signs, connivings and insinuations of a bro-
        			<lb break="no"/>ther-in-law. Thus, he was disinherited of 
        			<lb/>a portion that belonged to him by heredi-
        			<lb break="no"/>tary right. This circumstance, alone, 
        			<lb/>made such impressions on his mind, that 
        			<lb/>instead of being fired with a just spirit of 
        			<lb/>resentment and emulation, to supply, by 
        			<lb/>good application and economy, that of 
        			<lb/>which he had been unjustly deprived, he 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>was led into opposite pursuits, which she la-
        			<lb/>ments, as being his <emph style="font-style: italic">greatest misfortune</emph>.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			SUCH was her father’s local situation af-
        			<lb break="no"/>ter his marriage with her mother. She in-
        			<lb break="no"/>forms, that she had but very little knowl-
        			<lb break="no"/>edge of her father during her juvenile years. 
        			<lb/>Despairing of accumulating an interest by 
        			<lb/>his domestic employments, his bent of mind 
        			<lb/>led him to follow the sea-faring business, 
        			<lb/>which, as her mother informed her, he 
        			<lb/>commenced before her birth. However 
        			<lb/>great his prospects were, that fortune would 
        			<lb/>prove more propitious to his prosperity and 
        			<lb/>happiness upon the ocean, than it had done 
        			<lb/>on the land, he was effectually disappointed:
        			<lb/>—For after he had continued this fruitless 
        			<lb/>employment some years, he took a voyage 
        			<lb/>to some part of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, from whence he 
        			<lb/>was not heard of for some years. At length, 
        			<lb/>her mother was informed, he had perished 
        			<lb/>in a ship-wreck.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BY this time, his unsuccessful fortune, 
        			<lb/>both by land and sea, had the tendency to 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>break up his family. Her mother, howev-
        			<lb break="no"/>er, by her industry and economical man-
        			<lb break="no"/>agement, kept her family together as long 
        			<lb/>as possible after her husband’s supposed ca-
        			<lb break="no"/>tastrophe. But she, meeting with sickness, 
        			<lb/>and other providential misfortunes, was ob-
        			<lb break="no"/>liged, at length, to disband her family and 
        			<lb/>to scatter her children abroad.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IT may, perhaps, be remarked, that no-
        			<lb break="no"/>thing uncommonly singular has attended 
        			<lb/><persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName> in the primeval stages of her 
        			<lb/>life: Yet, the inquisitive and curious 
        			<lb/>mind, which is never tired in tracing the 
        			<lb/>events and performances of the most dis-
        			<lb break="no"/>tinguished characters, is wont to extend its 
        			<lb/>researches still further, and to enquire 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">where</emph> and <emph style="font-style: italic">how</emph> they have <emph style="font-style: italic">lived</emph>, and by what 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">methods</emph> and <emph style="font-style: italic">gradations</emph> they arrived at the 
        			<lb/>summit of their undertakings. I believe 
        			<lb/>it is a truth, to which we may generally as-
        			<lb break="no"/>sent, that most illustrious characters origin-
        			<lb break="no"/>ate, either from very <emph style="font-style: italic">low</emph> or very <emph style="font-style: italic">high</emph> 
        			<lb/>birth and circumstances.—I, therefore, beg 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>the reader’s indulgence, whilst I trace the 
        			<lb/>most singular circumstances and events 
        			<lb/>that occurred to <persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName> during her 
        			<lb/>juvenility; which may not be deemed 
        			<lb/>wholly useless and unentertaining.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			SHE was scarcely five years old, when 
        			<lb/>the separation from her mother was occa-
        			<lb break="no"/>sioned by indigent circumstances. The af-
        			<lb break="no"/>fectionate and prudent parent can best de-
        			<lb break="no"/>scribe the emotions experienced by the mo-
        			<lb break="no"/>ther and her daughter upon this occasion. 
        			<lb/>The young <persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName> had, already, 
        			<lb/>contracted an attachment to letters; and 
        			<lb/>in many other respects, promised fair to 
        			<lb/>crown the instructions and assiduity of a 
        			<lb/>parent, or patroness, with the most desir-
        			<lb break="no"/>able success. And it was with pain, her 
        			<lb/>mother saw these flattering symptoms with-
        			<lb break="no"/>out being able to promote, or scarcely to 
        			<lb/>encourage them by the fosterage of paren-
        			<lb break="no"/>tal care and affection. Nor was the dark-
        			<lb break="no"/>ness of the scene dissipated, until a distant 
        			<lb/>relation of her mother’s, an elderly maiden 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>by the name of <persName>FULLER</persName>, proffered to a-
        			<lb break="no"/>dopt her into her family, and take the 
        			<lb/>charge of her education.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THIS was a very honest and discreet la-
        			<lb break="no"/>dy. She shewed her young pupil many to-
        			<lb break="no"/>kens of care and affection. But as <persName>Miss 
        				<lb/>SAMPSON</persName> remarked—“<hi rend="italic">As I was born to be 
        					<lb/>unfortunate, my sun soon clouded</hi>.” She had 
        			<lb/>not continued in this agreeable situation 
        			<lb/>scarcely three years, before her benefac-
        			<lb break="no"/>tress was seized with a violent malady, 
        			<lb/>which, in a few days, proved fatal.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ALTHOUGH she was, at that time, not 
        			<lb/>more than eight years old, she was much 
        			<lb/>affected with the loss of her patroness.—
        			<lb/>She deemed it almost irreparable;—con-
        			<lb break="no"/>sidered herself without a home, or scarcely
        			<lb/>a friend to procure her one. But this scene 
        			<lb/>was too distressing to last long. Her moth-
        			<lb break="no"/>er, hearing of her circumstances, endeavor-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed to obtain a suitable place for her, till she 
        			<lb/>should come of age. She was put into one 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/><persName>Mrs. THATCHER’s</persName> family in <placeName>Middlebo-
        				<lb break="no"/>rough</placeName>, where she continued about two 
        			<lb/>years. This lady took particular care to 
        			<lb/>gratify her favorite propensity for reading, 
        			<lb/>&amp;c., but as she was of a slender constitu-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion, her mother removed her to <persName>Mr. JER-
        				<lb break="no"/>EMIAH THOMAS’s</persName>, of the same town.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IS it, indeed, sadly true, that nature, our 
        			<lb/>common source of being, is unequal in her 
        			<lb/>intellectual bestowments on the human spe-
        			<lb break="no"/>cies? If not, the apparent difference must 
        			<lb/>be in the manner, in which they are exhi-
        			<lb break="no"/>bited. This I am inclined to believe: 
        			<lb/>and the greatest remedy is education.—
        			<lb/>Hence the shrewd saying—“<hi rend="italic">Learning keeps 
        				<lb/>him out of fire and water</hi>.”—An excellent 
        			<lb/>stimulation for every one.—Logicians, I 
        			<lb/>trust, will allow me to form an estimation 
        			<lb/>of <persName>Miss SAMPSON’s</persName> endowments, even be-
        			<lb break="no"/>fore she had reached her teens. This I do, 
        			<lb/>without a design to flatter her into vain con-
        			<lb break="no"/>ceits of herself, or to wheedle any one of 
        			<lb/>the human species into her favor, or esteem 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>of the writer. It is a just tribute of respect 
        			<lb/>due to the <emph style="font-style: italic">illustrious poor</emph>.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			CERTAIN it is, that she early discovered, 
        			<lb/>at least to every judicious observer, tokens 
        			<lb/>of a fertile genius and an aspiring mind: 
        			<lb/>a mind quick of perception and of strong 
        			<lb/>penetration. And if it be allowable to 
        			<lb/>judge of things past, by their present as-
        			<lb break="no"/>pect, I hesitate not to announce, that her 
        			<lb/>primeval temper was uniform and tranquil. 
        			<lb/>Though destitute of many advantages of 
        			<lb/>education, she happened to fix on many ge-
        			<lb break="no"/>nuine principles. She may be noted for 
        			<lb/>a natural sweetness and pliability of tem-
        			<lb break="no"/>per—a ready wit, which only needed re-
        			<lb break="no"/>finement—a ready conformity to a parent’s, 
        			<lb/>or patroness’ injunctions—a native modesty 
        			<lb/>and softness in expression and deportment, 
        			<lb/>and passions naturally formed for philan-
        			<lb break="no"/>thropy and commiseration.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			A FURTHER enumeration might give oc-
        			<lb break="no"/>casion for a new apology. Nor have I a 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>right to describe her abilities in proportion 
        			<lb/>to the improvements she has since made. 
        			<lb/>I might fall into gross errors. Nature 
        			<lb/>might complain of injustice for making a 
        			<lb/>wrong estimate of her bounties. And it 
        			<lb/>is a truth, too often to be lamented, that 
        			<lb/>she oftener complains of <emph style="font-style: italic">uncultivated</emph> talents, 
        			<lb/>than for not <emph style="font-style: italic">giving any</emph> for cultivation. Our 
        			<lb/>endowments, of course, must be equal, if 
        			<lb/>not superior to our improvements.—
        			<lb/>Should the contrary be urged, those prin-
        			<lb break="no"/>ciples, which have dictated her exertions, 
        			<lb/>might lose a part of their energetic influ-
        			<lb break="no"/>ence; in which she still delights. Had she 
        			<lb/>shared greater advantages in education, she 
        			<lb/>might have much exceeded the proficiency 
        			<lb/>in erudition, but scarcely the singularity of 
        			<lb/>character, which she has since attained.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IT was a circumstance peculiarly unhap-
        			<lb break="no"/>py with <persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName>, during her minori-
        			<lb break="no"/>ty, that she found less <emph style="font-style: italic">opportunities</emph>, than <emph style="font-style: italic">in-
        				<lb break="no"/>clinations</emph>, for learning. The instances I 
        			<lb/>shall adduce to corroborate this assertion, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>will be comprised in the next chapter;—
        			<lb/>where the reader will find a general sketch 
        			<lb/>of her education during this period.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			I SHALL only add, that many of our hum-
        			<lb break="no"/>ble peasantry in <placeName>America</placeName>, would have 
        			<lb/>thanked fortune, if this evil had been con-
        			<lb break="no"/>fined to her. It is not so great a won-
        			<lb break="no"/>der as it is a lamentable truth, which, ob-
        			<lb break="no"/>servation in many families may evince, that 
        			<lb/>they have amassed together a greater bulk 
        			<lb/>of riches than of useful science; whilst, per-
        			<lb break="no"/>haps, the man, who never could obtain a 
        			<lb/>mediocrity of wealth, only needed it to 
        			<lb/>vie with them in every thing useful and 
        			<lb/>ornamental.—Thus, the most fertile genius, 
        			<lb/>like that of soil, which for want of proper 
        			<lb/>cultivation, is overrun with noxious weeds, 
        			<lb/>becomes corrupted by neglect and vicious 
        			<lb/>habit: and the <emph style="font-style: italic">inherent</emph> beauties that might 
        			<lb/>have eclipsed a more than ordinary show, 
        			<lb/>lie dormant.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			Where, then, could the GUARDIANS of 
        			<lb/>science have been secreted! Or, had they 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>not taken an universal charge of this grow-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing Empire!—Instances of this kind, how-
        			<lb break="no"/>ever, are more rarely met with than 
        			<lb/>formerly. And this error will always find 
        			<lb/>the best apology in the population of new 
        			<lb/>countries, where the means for subsistence 
        			<lb/>unavoidably demand the most attention. 
        			<lb/>But affluence, without being regulated by 
        			<lb/>refined education, cloys the sight of the be-
        			<lb break="no"/>holder; and the possessors are unqualified 
        			<lb/>for duty. The minds of people are now 
        			<lb/>roused by the introduction of new scenes 
        			<lb/>and objects. And it is here to be repeated, 
        			<lb/>to the honor of the citizens of <placeName>New Eng-
        				<lb break="no"/>land</placeName>, and the <placeName>United States</placeName> in general, that 
        			<lb/>they are, with success, endeavoring to 
        			<lb/>counterbalance this once prevailing evil; 
        			<lb/>at least, they would make an equilibrium 
        			<lb/>between their wealth and literature.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			Let not, therefore, any who have tal-
        			<lb break="no"/>ents for improvement, despair of success 
        		    <lb/>in any situation. Though a <seg xml:id="a015" corresp="#n015"><persName>FRANKLIN</persName>

        			WE are now to view <persName>Miss SAMP-
        				<lb break="no"/>SON</persName> advancing into the bloom and vigor 
        			<lb/>of youth. In this season, comes on the 
        			<lb/>trial of virtue and of the permanency of 
        			<lb/>that foundation, upon which improvements 
        			<lb/>have begun. The passions having assum-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed greater degrees of vigor, and still susc-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>eptible of quick and delicate impressions 
        			<lb/>from their natural attachment to the sexes, 
        			<lb/>and other alluring objects of pursuit; it 
        			<lb/>becomes accountable, that so many of both 
        			<lb/>sexes, especially those deprived of genuine 
        			<lb/>education, fail of that uniform course of 
        			<lb/>improvement in knowledge and virtue, 
        			<lb/>which is the only barrier against vice and 
        			<lb/>folly, and our surest guidance through life. 
        			<lb/>If she be found, at this age, persevering in 
        			<lb/>these duties and surmounting the principal 
        			<lb/>allurements to indecorum and vice, I need 
        			<lb/>not hesitate to announce her a singular 
        			<lb/>paradigm for many in better circumstances 
        			<lb/>and in higher life.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			FROM the time she went to live in <persName>Mr. 
        				<lb/>THOMAS’s</persName> family, till she was eighteen, it 
        			<lb/>may be said, she lived in common with oth-
        			<lb break="no"/>er youth of her own sex; except in two 
        			<lb/>very important respects:—She had <emph style="font-style: italic">stronger</emph> 
        			<lb/>propensities for improvement, and <emph style="font-style: italic">less</emph> op-
        			<lb break="no"/>portunities to acquire it. Industry and e-
        			<lb break="no"/>conomy—excellent virtues! being hered-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>itary in this family, she was, of course, inu-
        			<lb break="no"/>red to them. And as their children were 
        			<lb/>numerous, and chiefly of the masculine sex, 
        			<lb/>it is not improbable, that her athletic exer-
        			<lb break="no"/>cises were more intense on that account. 
        			<lb/>As they appeared more eager in the amas-
        			<lb break="no"/>sing of fortune, than of scientific acquisi-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion, she was obliged to check the bud, 
        			<lb/>which had already begun to expand, and to 
        			<lb/>yield the palm of the fulfilment of her du-
        			<lb break="no"/>ty to her superintendants in the manner 
        			<lb/>they deemed best, to the sacrifice of her 
        			<lb/>most endearing propensities. But painful 
        			<lb/>was the thought, that she must suffer the 
        			<lb/>bolt to be turned upon this, her favorite 
        			<lb/>pursuit. Wounding was the sight of oth-
        			<lb break="no"/>ers going to school, when she could not, <emph style="font-style: italic">be-
        				<lb break="no"/>cause she could not be spared</emph>. Her reflections 
        			<lb/>were singular, considering her age, when 
        		    <lb/>contrasting <emph style="font-style: italic">her</emph> <choice><sic>priviledges</sic><corr>privileges</corr></choice> with those of 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">other</emph> children, who had parents to take 
        			<lb/>the charge of their education. It was a 
        			<lb/>circumstance effectually mortifying to her, 
        			<lb/>that she could not hold familiarity, even 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>with the children of the family, on their 
        			<lb/>school-topics. But the ambition that agita-
        			<lb break="no"/>ted her mind, made her wont to believe her 
        			<lb/>lot as good as that of orphans in general.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HAPPY it was for her, at this age, that 
        			<lb/>neither mortification nor prohibition im-
        			<lb break="no"/>peded her inherent propensity for learning. 
        			<lb/>This, instead of being weakened, was 
        			<lb/>strengthened by time; though she had not 
        			<lb/>devised any effectual method to gratify it. 
        			<lb/>She had often heard—that <emph style="font-style: italic">a forward and 
        				<lb/>promising youth is short lived:</emph> But she did 
        			<lb/>not believe it. And, in this respect, her 
        			<lb/>longevity was rested on as good safety, as 
        			<lb/>was that of the wisest man: Nor have I 
        			<lb/>the least inclination to censure either.—
        			<lb/>The preceptor knows it is a task to kindle 
        			<lb/>sparks of emulation in most children; and 
        			<lb/>reason informs him, when they are <emph style="font-style: italic">natural-
        				<lb break="no"/>ly</emph> kindled, it is an injurious engine that ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>tinguishes the flame.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IT is the pride of some undisciplined, ty-
        			<lb break="no"/>rannical tempers to triumph over suppo-

        			<lb break="no"/>sed ignorance, distress and poverty. In 
        			<lb/>this, our better-deserving orphan found a 
        			<lb/>source of mortification. But magnanimity 
        			<lb/>and hope—ever soothing companions! el-
        			<lb break="no"/>evated her above despair. The ideas of 
        			<lb/>being rivalled by her mates in learning and 
        			<lb/>decorum, guarded their proper receptacle, 
        			<lb/>and prompted the establishment of the fol-
        			<lb break="no"/>lowing maxims:—<term style="font-style: italic">Never neglect the least cir-
        				<lb break="no"/>cumstance, that may be made conducive to im-
        				<lb break="no"/>provement: Opportunity is a precious compan-
        				<lb break="no"/>ion;</term> which is too often sadly verified by 
        			<lb/>the fool’s companions, <term style="font-style: italic">folly</term> and <term style="font-style: italic">procrastina-
        				<lb break="no"/>tion</term>—thieves, that rob the world of its treas-
        			<lb break="no"/>ure.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HER method was to listen to every 
        			<lb/>one she heard read and speak with propri-
        			<lb break="no"/>ety. And when she could, without intru-
        			<lb break="no"/>sion, catch the formation of a letter from 
        			<lb/>a penman, she gladly embraced it. She 
        			<lb/>used to obtain what school books and 
        			<lb/>copies she could from the children of the 
        			<lb/>family, as models for her imitation. Her 
        			<lb/>leisure interims were appropriated to these 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>tasks with as little reluctance, as common 
        			<lb/>children went to play.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			AVAILING herself of such methods with 
        			<lb/>unremitted ardor, together with promiscu-
        			<lb break="no"/>ous opportunities at school; she, at length, 
        			<lb/>found herself mistress of pronunciation and 
        			<lb/>sentences to such a degree, that she was a-
        			<lb break="no"/>ble to read, with propriety, in almost any 
        			<lb/>book in her language. The like applica-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion, in process of time, qualified her to 
        			<lb/>write a legible hand. As soon as she could 
        			<lb/>write, she voluntarily kept a journal of 
        			<lb/>common occurrences; an employment 
        			<lb/>not unworthy the humblest peasant, or the 
        			<lb/>most renowned sage.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE anxiety and aspirations of her mind 
        			<lb/>after knowledge, at length, became more 
        			<lb/>notorious to many, who made learning their 
        		    <lb/>element.

        			<lb break="no"/>ing expressions, and a donation of a few 
        			<lb/>books. And to mention the epistolary 
        			<lb/>correspondence, which she commenced at 
        			<lb/>the age of twelve, with a young lady of po-
        			<lb break="no"/>lite accomplishments, who had not only 
        			<lb/>offered to supply her with paper, but with 
        			<lb/>whatever instructions she could, would be 
        			<lb/>reminding her of a debt which she could 
        			<lb/>only repay by her gratitude for such ob-
        			<lb break="no"/>liging condescention. The correspond-
        			<lb break="no"/>ence was of much utility to her in her fu-
        			<lb break="no"/>ture employments.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			Thus, so much genius and taste were 
        			<lb/>not always to remain sequestered, like a 
        			<lb/>pearl in the bowels of the deep, or in an 
        			<lb/>inaccessible place. Nor must I insinuate 
        			<lb/>that she was here deprived of many other 
        			<lb/>principal advantages of education. She 
        		    <lb/>fared well for food and <seg xml:id="a020" corresp="#n020">raiment;</seg><note xml:id="n020" corresp="#a020"><term style="font-style: italic">Raiment</term>: clothing.</note> and that, 
        			<lb/>she reflected, was better than could be said 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>of many of her surrounding companions. 
        			<lb/>It is with respect and gratitude she speaks 
        			<lb/>of her superintendants on many other ac-
        			<lb break="no"/>counts. She has often said with emotion, 
        			<lb/>that the most mortifying punishment she 
        			<lb/>ever received from her master, was—“<term style="font-style: italic">You

        			<lb/>They not only carefully habituated her to

        			<lb/>and virtue, which, she thinks, could not 
        			<lb/>have failed to have been beneficial to any 
        			<lb/>one, whose heart had not been too much 
        			<lb/>tipped with adamantine hardness, or whose 
        			<lb/>faculties had not been totally wrapped in 
        			<lb/>inattention. Indeed, the laborious exer-
        			<lb break="no"/>cises, to which she was accustomed, during 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>her stay in this family, may be considered 
        			<lb/>of real service to her. They added strength 
        			<lb/>and permanency to her naturally good con-
        			<lb break="no"/>stitution, kept the mind awake to improve-
        			<lb break="no"/>ments; for the mind will doze, when indo
        			<lb break="no"/>lence seizes the body, and thus prepared 
        			<lb/>her to endure the greater hardships, which

        			IT is with peculiar pleasure, I here find 
        			<lb/>occasion to speak of <persName>Miss SAMPSON’s</persName> <emph style="font-style: italic">taste</emph> 
        			<lb/>for the study of <emph style="font-style: italic">Nature</emph>, or <emph style="font-style: italic">Natural Philoso-

        			THAT <emph style="font-style: italic">Philosophy</emph> should ever have been 
        			<lb/>treated with indifference, much less, with 
        			<lb/>intentional neglect, is an idea that affords 
        			<lb/>singular astonishment to every rational 
        			<lb/>mind. The <emph style="font-style: italic">philosopher</emph> has been consider-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed as—<emph style="font-style: italic">not a man of this world; as an unsocial

        				<lb/>sphere</emph>, in which we are enjoined to act by 
        			<lb/>nature, reason and religion; which serve as 
        			<lb/>a directory, or auxiliaries to accelerate us 
        			<lb/>in it. The <emph style="font-style: italic">philosopher</emph>, then, instead of be-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing rendered a <emph style="font-style: italic">useless object</emph> in society, and 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">wanting</emph> in the general <emph style="font-style: italic">duties</emph> of life, is the 
        			<lb/>person most eminently qualified for a <emph style="font-style: italic">use-

        				<lb/>calculated for an <emph style="font-style: italic">intercourse</emph> and <emph style="font-style: italic">union</emph> with 
        				<lb/>the sexes, best acquainted with the social

        				<lb break="no"/>paring himself for a more refined BEING in 
        				<lb/>futurity.

        		<p>
        			IT must then have been, merely, from 
        			<lb/>the <emph style="font-style: italic">abstruseness</emph>, which many people have

        			<lb/>philosophy may have been deemed for the 
        			<lb/>man of sense, and much more dangerous 
        			<lb break="no"/>for the other sex; it is certain, that it is now 
        			<lb/>emerging from an obsolete state, to that of 
        			<lb/>a fashionable and reputable employment. 
        			<lb/>Ignorance in it being now the thing mostly

        		<p>
        		    I LEARN from <persName>Miss SAMPSON’s</persName> <seg xml:id="a023" corresp="#n023">diurnals,</seg><note xml:id="n023" corresp="#a023"><term style="font-style: italic">Diurnals</term>: diaries.</note> 
        			<lb/>and from the credibility of others, that she 
        			<lb/>early discovered a <emph style="font-style: italic">taste</emph> for the contempla-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion of the objects and appearances exhib-
        			<lb break="no"/>ited in creation. She was notorious for 
        			<lb/>her frequent interrogatories relative to 
        			<lb/>their nature, use and end. Nor is this, in 
        			<lb/>a degree, unnatural for children in general. 
        			<lb/>Natural Creation is a source that first ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>cites the notice and attention of all. I 
        			<lb/>have myself observed, even infants, after 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>long confinement, appear reanimated and 
        			<lb/>filled with admiration on being again 
        			<lb/>brought into the refulgence of the Sun or 
        			<lb/>Moon, the spangled appearance of the stars, 
        			<lb/>the enamelled mead, the aspiring grove, 
        			<lb/>or a single floweret. Thus, they make it 
        			<lb/>a voluntary act to enquire into their origin, 
        			<lb/>use and end: Whereas, it often happens, 
        			<lb/>that the same child, by reason of some nur-
        			<lb break="no"/>sed, ill habit of temper, will brook no con-
        			<lb break="no"/>troul by the best moral precept or example, 
        			<lb/>except it be from the dread of corporeal pun-
        			<lb break="no"/>ishment.—This, therefore, should rouze 
        			<lb/>the attention of parents. As the first dawn-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing of reason in their children displays it-
        			<lb break="no"/>self in this way, they should make it their 
        			<lb/>peculiar care to assist and encourage it in 
        			<lb/>every respect. Nature, indeed, may be 
        			<lb/>considered as a general monitor and instruc-
        			<lb break="no"/>tor: But it is from experience and practical 
        			<lb/>experiments that we are facilitated in the 
        			<lb/>acquisition of knowledge.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HER taste for the cultivation of plants 
        			<lb/>and vegetable productions in general, ap-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>pears to have been somewhat conspicuous 
        			<lb/>in her early years. And she has intimated 
        			<lb/>an idea of this kind, which, from its justness, 
        			<lb/>and the delicate effects it has on many of 
        			<lb/>the softer passions, induces me to notice it.—
        			<lb/>It has been a source of astonishment and 
        			<lb/>mortification to her, that so many of her 
        			<lb/>own, as well as of the other sex, can dwell, 
        			<lb/>with rapture, on a romantic scene of love, a 
        			<lb/>piece of painting or sculpture, and, per-
        			<lb break="no"/>haps, upon things of more trivial import-
        			<lb break="no"/>ance;—and yet can walk in the stately and 
        			<lb/>venerable grove, can gaze upon the beauti-
        			<lb break="no"/>fully variegated landscape, can look with 
        			<lb/>indifference upon the rose and tulip, or can 
        			<lb/>tread on a bank of violets and primroses, 
        			<lb/>without appearing to be affected with any 
        			<lb/>peculiar sensations and emotions. This 
        			<lb/>certainly proceeds from a wrong bias of the 
        			<lb/>mind in its fixing on its first objects of pur-
        			<lb break="no"/>suit. And parents cannot be too careful 
        			<lb/>in the prevention of such errors, when they 
        			<lb/>are forming the minds of their offspring for 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>the courses, which are to affect the passions, 
        			<lb/>and give sway to the behavior during life.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			I KNOW not whether it was from her men-
        			<lb break="no"/>tal application to books, instructions from 
        			<lb/>public or private preceptors, or from her 
        			<lb/>own observations on <emph style="font-style: italic">nature</emph>, that she acquir-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed the most knowledge of philosophy and 
        			<lb/>astronomy. Perhaps, it was from some ad-
        			<lb break="no"/>vantage of the whole. I am, however au-
        			<lb break="no"/>thorized to say, both from her infant mem-
        			<lb break="no"/>orandums and verbal communications, that 
        			<lb/>she did obtain, during her juvenility, many 
        			<lb/>just ideas respecting them. She has assur-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed me, the questions she used to ask, rela-
        			<lb break="no"/>tive to the <emph style="font-style: italic">rising</emph> and <emph style="font-style: italic">setting</emph> of the Sun, 
        			<lb/>Moon, &amp;c., never ceased agitating her mind 
        			<lb/>till she had formed proper ideas of the 
        		    <lb/>spherical figure of the Earth, and of its <seg xml:id="a024" corresp="#n024">di-

        			<lb break="no"/>ner, she acquired a smattering of the <emph style="font-style: italic">Solar 
        				<lb/>System</emph>. But she has no wish even now, for 
        			<lb/>having the appellation, <term style="font-style: italic">philosopher</term>, or <term style="font-style: italic">astron-
        				<lb break="no"/>omer</term>, conferred on her But my readers 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>may conclude, it is, merely on account of her 
        			<lb/>fancied <emph style="font-style: italic">ignorance</emph> of those sublime sciences.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			SHE frequently made it her custom to rise 
        			<lb/>in the morning before twilight. During 
        			<lb/>the Spring, Summer and Autumn, it seems, 
        			<lb/>she was peculiarly attached to rural specu-
        			<lb break="no"/>lation. And, as though she had been a 
        			<lb/>Shepherdess, she was frequently seen in some 
        			<lb/>adjacent field, when the radiant orb of day 
        			<lb/>first gleamed on the hill tops to cheer and 
        			<lb/>animate vegetable nature with his prolific 
        			<lb/>and penetrating rays.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE studious and contemplative mind 
        			<lb/>can best interpret her motive in this, and 
        			<lb/>the utility of it. To those, who have sel-
        			<lb break="no"/>dom or never enjoyed the delicious re-
        			<lb break="no"/>pasts of this tranquil hour, it may be said—
        			<lb/>the mind, like the body, having rested from 
        			<lb/>the toils and bustle of the day, awakes in 
        			<lb/>a state of sereneness the best calculated for 
        			<lb/>contemplation, for the reception and im-
        			<lb break="no"/>pression of ideas, which this season, above 
        			<lb/>all others, seems capable of affording.—

        			<lb/>The physician may also inform, that <term style="font-style: italic">early 
        				<lb/>rising</term> is a cordial and preservative of

        			<lb/>pallid countenance, and mind staggering 
        			<lb/>with the weight of an inactive body of him,

        			THE dawning of day—when the sun is

        			<lb/>reanimation, each tribe of instinct hasten-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing to its respective occupation, and man, 
        			<lb/>who had been confined in morbid inactiv-
        			<lb break="no"/>ity, reassuming strength and cheerfulness—
        			<lb/>is emblematic of CREATION rising out of 
        			<lb/>its original chaos, or non-existence. Sure-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly then, this scene cannot fail of filling the 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">philosophic mind</emph> with just and sublime ideas, 
        			<lb/>and with the purest love and gratitude to

        			<persName>MISS SAMPSON</persName> has repeatedly said, that

        			<lb break="no"/>icence of DEITY than in the contempla-

        			<lb/>are perpetually whirling with the most in-

        			<lb/>Surely then the mind, that is not lost to all

        			<lb/>filled with ideas the most dignified, with

        		<p>
        			AS <persName>MISS SAMPSON</persName> had a natural attach-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment to the study of <emph style="font-style: italic">creation</emph>, it would have 
        			<lb/>been unnatural, and even criminal, to have 
        			<lb/>been negligent in forming an acquaintance 
        			<lb/>with her own nature—with its important 
        			<lb/>use and end. Every thing in nature, as 
        			<lb/>well as in reason, enjoins this as a duty. The 
        			<lb/>uniformity every where observable in cre-
        			<lb break="no"/>ation, doubtless, was influential and sub-
        			<lb break="no"/>servient to the regulation of her moral and 
        			<lb/>civil life. This may excite an idea of nov-
        			<lb break="no"/>elty with those, who do not studiously at-
        			<lb break="no"/>tend the <emph style="font-style: italic">lectures</emph> of Nature. But had we 
        			<lb/>no other directory, by which we could reg-
        			<lb break="no"/>ulate our lives and conduct, and were it not 
        			<lb/>possible to deviate from this, there would 
        			<lb/>be less danger of the confusion so often vis-
        			<lb break="no"/>ible among mankind, of immorality, and of 
        			<lb/>the sword, which is, even now, deluging 
        			<lb/>such a part of the world in blood.

        		<p>
        			FROM an habitual course of speculations 
        			<lb/>like these, she may be said to have been 
        			<lb/>seasonably impressed with the following 
        			<lb/>theoretical conclusions drawn from them: 
        			<lb/>That human nature is born in imperfec-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion; the great <emph style="font-style: italic">business</emph> of which is <emph style="font-style: italic">refinement</emph>, 
        				<lb/>and constant endeavors of approximation 
        			<lb/>to perfection and happiness;—That igno-
        			<lb break="no"/>rance and the general train of evils are the 
        			<lb/>natural offspring of inattention, and that all 
        			<lb/>tend to the degradation of our nature;—
        			<lb/>And that diligent application is the great 
        			<lb/>requisite for improvement; which, only, 
        			<lb/>can dignify and exalt our nature and our 
        			<lb/>character.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THESE traits, I venture to affirm, are 
        			<lb/>some of the primeval exertions of those en-
        			<lb break="no"/>dowments, which are so peculiarly charac-
        			<lb break="no"/>teristic of our rectitude and worth. They 
        			<lb/>are <emph style="font-style: italic">leading principles</emph> of life. I take the lib-
        			<lb break="no"/>erty to call them <emph style="font-style: italic">spontaneous</emph>; because they 
        			<lb/>are, more or less, <emph style="font-style: italic">natural</emph> to every one.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			IMPELLED by desires to promote virtue 
        			<lb/>and decorum, as well as by justice, I here 
        			<lb/>mention one more trait of her juvenility: 
        			<lb/>and I could wish it might not distinguish 
        			<lb/>her from others at this day.—During this 
        			<lb/>season, it may be said, she was generally a 
        			<lb/>stranger and showed an aversion to all ir-
        			<lb break="no"/>regular and untimely diversions. Nor is 
        		    <lb/>she more deserving a <seg xml:id="a027" corresp="#n027">panegyric</seg><note xml:id="n027" corresp="#a027"><term style="font-style: italic">Panegyric</term>: formal statement of praise.</note> on this ac-
        			<lb break="no"/>count than her superintendents. She despis-
        		    <lb break="no"/>ed revelry, gossipping, detraction and <seg xml:id="a028" corresp="#n028">or-
        		        <lb break="no"/>gies,</seg><note xml:id="n028" corresp="#a028"><term style="font-style: italic">Orgies</term>: secret rituals.</note> not because she was, originally, any 
        		    <lb/>better than others, but <seg xml:id="a029" corresp="#n029">because genuine na-
        		        <lb break="no"/>ture exhibits no such examples</seg><note xml:id="n029" corresp="#a029">This phrase was removed from the 19C edition.</note>—because 
        			<lb/>they were unfashionable in her neighbor-
        			<lb break="no"/>hood;—and, especially, because her mas-
        			<lb break="no"/>ter and mistress not only disapproved, but 
        			<lb/>prohibited them. This theory is certainly 
        			<lb/>good, however bad her practice hereafter 
        			<lb/>may appear. Their <term style="font­-style: italic">practice</term>, rather than 
        			<lb/>their <term style="font­-style: italic">name</term> should be struck out of time.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			PERHAPS I make a greater distinction, 
        			<lb/>than many do, between what is called the 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>universal ruin of nature, and that occasion-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed by wrong education. We call <term style="font­-style: italic">nature</term> 
        			<lb/>corrupt: instead of which, we may say <term style="font­-style: italic">cor-
        				<lb break="no"/>poreal substance</term>. The immortal part of man 
        			<lb/>is pure; and it is the pride of genuine na-
        			<lb break="no"/>ture to keep it so. It is embarrassed many 
        			<lb/>times by a vicious body: but it will remain 
        			<lb/>uncontaminated, though the body tumbles 
        			<lb/>into dissolution.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			CUSTOM bears great sway; even the pal-
        			<lb break="no"/>ate may be made to relish any diet by cus-
        			<lb break="no"/>tom. But this argues not, that anything 
        			<lb/>can be received by the stomach without 
        			<lb/>danger. We are the pilots of our chil-
        			<lb break="no"/>dren; and on us they depend for safety. 
        			<lb/>They learn by imitation, as well as by pre-
        			<lb break="no"/>cept. And I have either read, heard or 
        			<lb/>thought, (no matter which) that children 
        			<lb/>will always be gazing on the <emph style="font-style: italic">signs</emph> their pa-
        			<lb break="no"/>rents have <emph style="font-style: italic">lettered</emph>.—We wish for reforma-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion in youth; but let age be careful to lay 
        			<lb/>the foundation stone.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IT is not presumed that <persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName> 
        			<lb/>was, at this age, without her particular 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>blemishes and foibles. Like others desti-
        			<lb break="no"/>tute of principal advantages of education, 
        			<lb/>she was doubtless culpable for the misim-
        			<lb break="no"/>provement of much time and many talents. 
        			<lb/>Whilst her superintendents may corrobo-
        			<lb break="no"/>rate this, they are ready to do her the jus-
        			<lb break="no"/>tice of saying, that she was a lover of order 
        			<lb/>in their family—punctual in the fulfilment 
        			<lb/>of her duty to them, and assiduous to heigh-
        			<lb break="no"/>ten their regard for her. And that her 
        			<lb/>obligations of this nature did not terminate 
        			<lb/>here, many of her cotemporaries, I dare 
        			<lb/>say, can testify. Studious to increase a re-
        			<lb break="no"/>ciprocity of affection with her relations and 
        			<lb/>surrounding companions, she was success-
        			<lb break="no"/>ful. To behave with temperance to stran-
        			<lb break="no"/>gers, is what she deemed a step of prudence: 
        			<lb/>But to show an indifference, or actually 
        			<lb/>to disoblige a friend or companion, could 
        			<lb/>only be repaid by redoubled attention 
        			<lb/>to restore them to her favor, and by ac-
        			<lb break="no"/>knowledged gratitude for their lenity.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			ON the whole, we must look upon her 
        			<lb/>endowments, in general, during her juve-
        			<lb break="no"/>nility, as the statuary may look upon his 
        			<lb/>marble in the quarry; or as any one may 
        		    <lb/>look upon a rich <choice><sic>peace</sic><corr>piece</corr></choice> of painting or sculp-
        			<lb break="no"/>ture, which combines uniformity with pro-
        			<lb break="no"/>fusion; yet where the hand of the artist has 
        			<lb/>not discovered every latent beauty, nor 
        			<lb/>added a finishing polish to those that are 
        			<lb/>apparent.

        			THE motives, that led to hostili-
        			<lb break="no"/>ties between <placeName>North America</placeName> and <placeName>Great 
        				<lb/>Britain</placeName>, and the period that terminated our

        			<lb/>are events the most singular and important 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>we have ever known:—<emph style="font-style: italic">singular</emph>, because, 
        			<lb/>in their very <emph style="font-style: italic">nature</emph>, they were <emph style="font-style: italic">unnatural</emph>;—
        				<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">important</emph>, because, on them depended the

        		</p>
        		<p>
        			The operations of these affairs, both be-
        			<lb break="no"/>fore and after the first engagement at <placeName>Lex-
        				<lb break="no"/>ington</placeName>, are well known to have affected the 
        			<lb/>minds, even of both sexes, throughout the 
        			<lb/><placeName>Colonies</placeName>, with sensations and emotions dif-
        			<lb break="no"/>ferent from whatever they had before ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>perienced. Our progenitors had suffered 
        			<lb/>almost every hardship in their first settle-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment of this country; and much bloodshed 
        			<lb/>by the Aborigines. But these are events 
        			<lb/>that naturally attend the population of new 
        			<lb/>countries; and consequently, naturally an-
        			<lb break="no"/>ticipated. But when our property, which 
        			<lb/>our ancestors had honestly acquired, was 
        			<lb/>invaded; when our inherent rights were 
        			<lb/>either prohibited or infringed, an alarm was 
        			<lb/>universally given; and our minds were ef-
        			<lb break="no"/>fectually awakened to the keenest sense of 
        			<lb/>the injuries, and naturally remained in dis-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>tress, till we became exempt from their ju-
        			<lb break="no"/>risdiction.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			PERHAPS the public may not be surprised, 
        			<lb/>that events, so interesting and important, 
        			<lb/>should arrest the attention of any one.—
        			<lb/>But when either of the sexes reverses its 
        			<lb/>common sphere of action, our curiosity is 
        			<lb/>excited to know the cause and event. The 
        			<lb/>field of war is a department peculiarly as-
        			<lb break="no"/>signed to the hero. It may, therefore, ap-
        			<lb break="no"/>pear somewhat curious, if not interesting 
        			<lb/>to many, when they are informed, that <emph style="font-style: italic">this</emph> 
        			<lb/>uncommonly arrested the attention of a 
        			<lb/>YOUNG FEMALE of low birth and station. 
        			<lb/><persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName> is the one, who not only lis-
        			<lb break="no"/>tened to the least information relative to 
        			<lb/>the rise and progress of the late American 
        			<lb/>War; but her thoughts were, at times, en-
        			<lb break="no"/>grossed with it.—I will analyze them, as I 
        			<lb/>find them sketched in her credentials, or 
        			<lb/>as I learn them from credible authorities.

        			BEFORE the blockade of <placeName>Boston</placeName>, <date when="1775-03-05">March 
        				<lb/>5th, 1775</date>, by the British, the <placeName>Colonies</placeName> had 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>been thrown into great confusion and dis-
        			<lb break="no"/>tress by repeated acts of oppression by the 
        			<lb/>British, that produced riots, which, in <placeName>Bos-
        				<lb break="no"/>ton</placeName>, were carried to the greatest extremi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ties. It was not till this time, that <persName>Miss 
        				<lb/>SAMPSON</persName> obtained information of the arri-
        			<lb break="no"/>val of the <persName>King’s</persName> troops, and of the spir-
        			<lb break="no"/>ited opposition maintained by the Ameri-
        			<lb break="no"/>cans. She justly learned, that it was the 
        			<lb/>Acts of the British Parliament to raise a 
        		    <lb/>revenue, <seg xml:id="a030" corresp="#n030">in <placeName>America</placeName>,</seg><note xml:id="n030" corresp="#a030">“in <placeName>America</placeName>” added per original list of Errata.</note> without her consent, that gave 
        			<lb/>rise to these cruel and unjust measures. 
        			<lb/>Had she possessed information and experi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ence on the subject, like many others, she 
        			<lb/>would doubtless, like them, have seen the 
        			<lb/>impropriety, that <placeName>England</placeName> should have an 
        			<lb/>unlimited controul over us, who are sepa-
        			<lb break="no"/>rated from her by the vast <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>, at 
        			<lb/>least, three thousand miles.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BUT so it was.—From the first es-

        			<lb/>Government; and thus continued tribu-
        			<lb break="no"/>tary to her laws. And as though it had not 
        			<lb/>been enough, that she had driven many of 
        			<lb/>our ancestors from their native clime, by 
        			<lb/>the intolerant and unrelenting spirit of her 
        			<lb/>religious persecution, to seek a new world, 
        			<lb/>and to suffer the distress naturally conse-

        			<persName>MISS SAMPSON</persName>, though not an eye-wit-
        			<lb break="no"/>ness of this distress, was not insensible of it. 
        			<lb/>She learned that the inhabitants of <placeName>Boston</placeName> 
        			<lb/>were confined by an unprovoked <emph style="font-style: italic">enemy</emph>;
        			<lb/>that they were not only upon the point of 
        			<lb/>perishing for want of sustenance, but that 
        			<lb/>many had been actually massacred, their 
        			<lb/>public and private buildings of elegance 
        			<lb/>shamefully defaced, or quite demolished; 
        			<lb/>and that many of her own sex were either 
        			<lb/>ravished, or deluded to the sacrifice of 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>their chastity, which she had been taught 
        			<lb/>to revere even as dear as life itself.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THESE thoughts filled her mind with sen-
        			<lb break="no"/>sations, to which she had hitherto been un-
        			<lb break="no"/>accustomed—with a kind of enthusiasm, 
        			<lb/>which strengthened and increased with the 
        			<lb/>progression of the war; and which, per-
        			<lb break="no"/>adventure, fixed her mind in a situation, 
        			<lb/>from which, she afterwards found it impos-
        			<lb break="no"/>sible to be extricated, until the accom-
        			<lb break="no"/>plishment of the object, after which it as-
        			<lb break="no"/>pired.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			DURING her residence in <persName>Mr. Thomas’s</persName> 
        			<lb/>family, they granted her many domestic 
        			<lb/>privileges;—such as the use of a number 
        			<lb/>of fowls, sheep, &amp;c., upon condition, that 
        			<lb/>she would appropriate the profit arising 
        			<lb/>from them to the attainment of objects use-
        			<lb break="no"/>ful and ornamental. This was an effectu-
        			<lb break="no"/>al method to inure her to <emph style="font-style: italic">method</emph> and a 
        			<lb/>proper <emph style="font-style: italic">use</emph> of money. She applied herself 
        			<lb/>to the business with diligence and success. 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>And, at this time, she had accumulated a 
        			<lb/>small stock, which was appropriated, agree-
        			<lb break="no"/>ably to her notion, perfectly coincident to 
        			<lb/>the injunction. The poor people of <placeName>Bos-
        				<lb break="no"/>ton</placeName> were reduced to the piteous necessity 
        			<lb/>of asking <emph style="font-style: italic">charity</emph>, or <emph style="font-style: italic">contribution</emph> from the 
        			<lb/>country inhabitants. This was no soon-
        			<lb break="no"/>er known to her than she experienced an 
        			<lb/>anxiety, that could brook no controul, un-
        		    <lb break="no"/>til she had an opportunity of <seg xml:id="a032" corresp="#n032"><emph style="font-style: italic">casting in her 
        		        <lb/>mite</emph>:</seg><note xml:id="n032" corresp="#a032"><term style="font-style: italic">Casting in her mite</term>: an allusion to <bibl>Mark 12:42</bibl>, in which a poor widow contributes two mites, or small coins.</note> Upon which, she sincerely congrat-
        			<lb break="no"/>ulated herself, not upon the principle, that 
        			<lb/>any one owed her any more gratitude; but 
        			<lb/>upon the consciousness of having endeav-
        			<lb break="no"/>oured to relieve the innocent and distressed.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THOUGH I am as much disinclined to 
        			<lb/>have faith in common dreams as in any in-
        			<lb break="no"/>vented fable, or to spend time in reciting 
        			<lb/>their ominous interpretations; yet as they 
        			<lb/>proceed from that immortal part of man, 
        			<lb/>which no one ought to slight, they may 
        			<lb/>sometimes be of use. I cannot help notic-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing in this place, a phenomenon presented 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>to the mind of <persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName> during her 
        			<lb/>nocturnal repose, <date when="1775-04-15">April 15, 1775</date>, in the fif-
        			<lb break="no"/>teenth year of her age, and but four days 
        			<lb/>before the battle at <placeName>Lexington</placeName>. I insert 
        			<lb/>the principal part of it in her own language, and 
        			<lb/>some of the latter part, verbatim.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			“As I slept, I thought, as the Sun was 
        			<lb/>declining beneath our hemisphere, an unu-
        			<lb break="no"/>sual softness and sereneness of weather in-
        			<lb break="no"/>vited me abroad to perambulate the <emph style="font-style: italic">Works</emph> 
        			<lb/>of <emph style="font-style: italic">Nature</emph>. I gladly embraced the oppor-
        			<lb break="no"/>tunity; and with eager steps and pensive 
        			<lb/>mind quickly found myself environed in 
        			<lb/>the adjacent fields, which were decorated 
        			<lb/>with the greatest profusion of delights. The 
        			<lb/>gentle ascending ground on one side, upon 
        			<lb/>which were grazing numerous kinds of 
        			<lb/>herds; the pleasant and fertile valley and 
        			<lb/>meadow, through which meandered small 
        			<lb/>rivulets on the other; the aspiring and 
        			<lb/>venerable grove, either before or behind 
        		    <lb/>me; the <seg xml:id="a033" corresp="#n033">zephyrs,</seg><note xml:id="n033" corresp="#a033"><term style="font-style: italic">Zephyrs</term>: breezes.</note> which were gently fan-
        			<lb break="no"/>ning the boughs, and the sweet caroling of 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>the birds in the branches; the husband-
        			<lb break="no"/>men, intent upon their honorable and most 
        			<lb/>useful employment, <emph style="font-style: italic">agriculture</emph>; the earth, 
        			<lb/>then cloathed with vegetation, which alrea-
        			<lb break="no"/>dy filled the air with ravishing odours;—
        			<lb/>all conspired to fill my mind with sensa-
        			<lb break="no"/>tions hitherto unknown, and to direct it to 
        			<lb/>a realization of the AUTHOR of their be-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing whose power, wisdom and goodness are, 
        			<lb/>as they manifest, as infinite as they are per-
        			<lb break="no"/>petual.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			STUDIOUS in contemplating the objects 
        			<lb/>that surrounded me, I should have been 
        			<lb/>barbarous, and perhaps, have deprived 
        			<lb/>myself of advantages, which I never might 
        			<lb/>again possess, had I abruptly quitted my 
        			<lb/>ramble. I prolonged it, till I found my-
        			<lb break="no"/>self advanced upon a lofty eminence that 
        			<lb/>overlooked a far more extensive and beau-
        			<lb break="no"/>tiful prospect, both of the ocean and con-
        			<lb break="no"/>tinent.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HAVING reached the summit, I sat down 
        			<lb/>to indulge such thoughts as the scene seem-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>ed altogether capable of inspiring.—How 
        			<lb/>much, thought I, is it to be regretted, that 
        			<lb/>I am not always filled with the same <choice><sic>sensasations</sic><corr>sensa-
        			<lb break="no"/>tions</corr></choice>, with such sublime ideas of CREA-
        			<lb break="no"/>TION, and of that BEING, who has caused it 
        			<lb/>to exist! Indeed, I fancied, I could joyful-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly have spent my life in researches for 
        			<lb/>knowledge in this delightsome way.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BUT how great was my astonishment and 
        			<lb/>horror at the reversion of the scene! An 
        			<lb/>unusual appearance, different from what-
        			<lb break="no"/>ever my eyes beheld, or imagination sug-
        			<lb break="no"/>gested, was, at once, cast on everything 
        			<lb/>that surrounded me. The sky, which before 
        			<lb/>was so pleasant and serene, suddenly low-
        			<lb break="no"/>ered, and became, instantaneously, veiled 
        			<lb/>with blackness. Though not altogether 
        			<lb/>like a common tempest, incessant <emph style="font-style: italic">lightning</emph> 
        			<lb/>and tremendous peals of <emph style="font-style: italic">thunder</emph> seemed to 
        			<lb/>lacerate the very vaults of nature. The 
        		    <lb/><seg xml:id="a034" corresp="#n034">ambrosial</seg><note xml:id="n034" corresp="#a034"><term style="font-style: italic">Ambrosial</term>: divine or celestial.</note> sweets of vegetation were ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>changed for the nauseous stenches of sul-
        			<lb break="no"/>phur and other once condensed bodies that 
        			<lb/>seemed to float in ether.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			HAPPENING, at this instant, to cast my 
        			<lb/>eyes upon the liquid element, <emph style="font-style: italic">new amaze-
        				<lb break="no"/>ment</emph> was added to the scene. Its surface, 
        			<lb/>which before was unruffled, was now prop-
        			<lb break="no"/>erly convulsed, and seemed piled in moun-
        			<lb break="no"/>tains to the sky. The ships, that before 
        			<lb/>were either anchored, or riding with tran-
        		    <lb break="no"/>quillity to their harbors, at once <seg xml:id="a035" corresp="#n035">dismasted,</seg><note xml:id="n035" corresp="#a035"><term style="font-style: italic">Dismasted</term>: lost its mast(s), the pole(s) holding the sails.</note> 
        			<lb/>dashing against rocks and one another, or 
        			<lb/>floundering amidst the surges. The indus-
        			<lb break="no"/>trious farmers, many of whom were visited 
        			<lb/>by their consorts in their rural occupa-
        			<lb break="no"/>tions, seemed dispersed, and flying for re-
        			<lb break="no"/>fuge to the nearest place of safety. And 
        			<lb/>the birds and bestial tribes seemed at a loss 
        			<lb/>where to go, being in as great confusion as 
        			<lb/>the elements.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			FILLED with astonishment at this dis-
        			<lb break="no"/>traction of the elements, without any fixed 
        			<lb/>precaution what method to take for safety; 
        			<lb/>on the one side, the earth, a volcano, which 
        			<lb/>shook with the perpetual roar of thunder; 
        			<lb/>and on the other side, the liquid element 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>foaming to the clouds—my reason seemed 
        			<lb/>entirely to forsake me, on beholding the 
        			<lb/>most hideous <emph style="font-style: italic">serpent</emph> roll itself from the 
        			<lb/>ocean. He advanced, and seemed to 
        			<lb/>threaten <emph style="font-style: italic">carnage</emph> and <emph style="font-style: italic">destruction</emph> wherever 
        				<lb/>he went. At length, he approached me, 
        			<lb/>with a velocity which I expected would 
        			<lb/>instantly have cost me my life. I happen-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed to be directed homeward; but looking 
        			<lb/>back, and perceiving the <emph style="font-style: italic">streets</emph>, through 
        			<lb/>which he passed, <emph style="font-style: italic">drenched in blood</emph>, I fell in-
        			<lb break="no"/>to a swoon. In this condition, I know 
        			<lb/>not how long I remained. At length, I 
        			<lb/>found myself, (as I really was) in my own 
        			<lb/>apartment; where I hoped not to be again 
        			<lb/>shocked with the terrific and impending 
        			<lb/>destruction of the <emph style="font-style: italic">elements</emph> or <emph style="font-style: italic">monster</emph>.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BUT to my repeated grief and amaze-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment, I beheld the door of the apartment 
        			<lb/>open of itself; and the <emph style="font-style: italic">serpent</emph>, in a more 
        			<lb/>frightful form and <emph style="font-style: italic">venomous</emph> in looks, re-
        			<lb break="no"/>appeared. He was of immense bigness; 
        			<lb/>his mouth opened wide, and teeth of great 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>length. His tongue appeared to have a 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">sharp sting</emph> in the end. He entered the 
        			<lb/>room; but it was not of sufficient dimen-
        			<lb break="no"/>sions for his length. As he advanced to-
        			<lb break="no"/>wards my bed-side, his head raised, as near-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly as I conjectured, about five or six feet, 
        			<lb/>his eyes resembled <emph style="font-style: italic">balls</emph> of <emph style="font-style: italic">fire</emph>. I was 
        			<lb/>frightened beyond description. I thought 
        			<lb/>I covered my head and tried to call for 
        			<lb/>assistance, but could make no noise.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			AT length, I heard a voice saying, “<hi rend="italic">Arise, 
        				<lb/>stand on your feet, gird yourself and prepare to 
        				<lb/>encounter your enemy</hi>.”—This seemed impos-
        			<lb break="no"/>sible; as I had no weapon of defence. I 
        			<lb/>rose up, stood upon the bed; but before I 
        			<lb/>had time to dress, the <hi rend="italic">serpent</hi> approached, 
        			<lb/>and seemed resolved to swallow me whole. 
        			<lb/>I thought I called on GOD for assistance 
        			<lb/>in these distressing moments: And at that 
        			<lb/>instant, I beheld, at my feet, a bludgeon, 
        			<lb/>which I readily took into my hand, and 
        			<lb/>immediately had a severe combat with the 
        			<lb/>enemy. He retreated towards the door, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>from whence he first entered. I pursued 
        			<lb/>him closely, and perceived, as he lowered 
        			<lb/>his head, he attempted to strike me with 
        			<lb/>his tail. His tail resembled that of a <emph style="font-style: italic">fish</emph>, 
        			<lb/>more than that of a <emph style="font-style: italic">serpent</emph>. It was divid-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed into several parts, and on each branch 
        			<lb/>there were <emph style="font-style: italic">capital letters</emph> of yellow gilt. I 
        			<lb/>pursued him, after he left the apartment, 
        		    <lb/>several <seg xml:id="a036" corresp="#n036">rods,</seg><note xml:id="n036" corresp="#a036"><term style="font-style: italic">Rod</term>: 16 ½ feet.</note> striking him every <choice><sic>opportuty</sic><corr>opportu-
        				<lb break="no"/>nity</corr></choice>; till at length, I dislocated every joint, 
        			<lb/>which fell in pieces to the ground: But the 
        			<lb/>pieces reunited, though not in the form of 
        			<lb/>a <emph style="font-style: italic">serpent</emph>, but in that of an <emph style="font-style: italic">Ox</emph>. He came 
        			<lb/>at me a second time, roaring and trying to 
        			<lb/>gore me with his horns. But I renewed 
        			<lb/>the attack with such resolution, and beat 
        			<lb/>him in such a manner, that he fell again 
        			<lb/>in pieces to the ground. I ran to gather 
        			<lb/>them; but on survey found them nothing 
        			<lb/>but a <emph style="font-style: italic">gelly</emph>.— And I immediately awoke.”
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THIS very singular <emph style="font-style: italic">Dream</emph> had an uncom-
        			<lb break="no"/>mon effect on her mind, and seemed to 
        			<lb/>presage some great event. The novelty 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>and momentous ideas it inspired, induced 
        			<lb/>her to record it; but she kept it secreted 
        			<lb/>from others. At that time she attempted 
        			<lb/>no particular interpretation of it.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ALTHOUGH the nature and limits of these 
        			<lb/>MEMOIRS will not admit of a connected 
        			<lb/>sketch of the American War; yet, as the 
        			<lb/>motives that led to open hostilities, and the 
        			<lb/>actions, in which the first blood was shed, 
        			<lb/>so peculiarly occupied the mind of a 
        			<lb/>young FEMALE, I cannot help following the

        			<lb/>and in which she afterwards became so dis-

        			<lb/>of those HEROES, who fell the first sacrifices 
        			<lb/>in the CAUSE of their COUNTRY, induce 
        			<lb/>me to dwell, for a few minutes on those

        			<lb/>they fire the mind and passions with genuine 
        			<lb/>love of LIBERTY and PATRIOTISM, must

        			THE repeated and unjust <emph style="font-style: italic">Acts of Parlia-
        				<lb break="no"/>ment</emph>, which they more strenuously endea-
        			<lb break="no"/>voured to enforce on the <placeName>Colonies</placeName>, seemed 
        			<lb/>to threaten general destruction; unless 
        			<lb/>they would, in <emph style="font-style: italic">One mutual Union</emph>, take eve-
        				<lb break="no"/>ry effectual method of resistance. For 
        			<lb/>this purpose, a CONGRESS had been form-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed; whose first business was to remon-
        			<lb break="no"/>strate and petition for redress. At the 
        			<lb/>same time, they had the precaution to 
        			<lb/>take methods for defence, in case their 
        			<lb/>voice should not be heard in Parliament. 
        			<lb/>Great encouragement was given for the 
        			<lb/>manufacture of all kinds of military stores 
        			<lb/>and apparatus. The militia were trained 
        			<lb/>to the use of arms.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			WHILST things were going on in this man-
        			<lb break="no"/>ner, a detachment of troops commanded 
        			<lb/>by <persName>Colonel SMITH</persName> and <persName>Major PITCAIRN</persName> 
        			<lb/>were sent from <placeName>Boston</placeName> to possess or destroy 
        			<lb/>some stores at <placeName>Concord</placeName>, twenty miles from 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/><placeName>Boston</placeName>. At <placeName>Lexington</placeName> a few companies 
        			<lb/>were collected for the purpose of manœu-
        			<lb break="no"/>vring, or to oppose the incursions of the 
        			<lb/>British. These, as some accounts say, were 
        			<lb/>ordered by the British commander, with 
        			<lb/>the epithet of <term style="font-style: italic">damn’d rebels</term>, to disperse. 
        			<lb/>Whether they so readily complied with 
        			<lb/>the injunction as he wished, or not, he or-
        			<lb break="no"/>dered his troops to fire upon them; and 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">eight men</emph> were instantly the victims of 
        			<lb/>death.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			AFTER the dispersion of the militia, the 
        			<lb/>troops proceeded to <placeName>Concord</placeName> and destroy-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed a few stores. But by this time the mi-
        			<lb break="no"/>litia had collected from the adjacent towns, 
        			<lb/>and seemed unanimously resolved to 
        			<lb/>avenge, by severe retaliation, the death of 
        			<lb/>their innocent brethren. This the troops 
        			<lb/>effectually experienced during their pre-
        			<lb break="no"/>cipitate march to <placeName>Boston</placeName>.

        			WHO but the actors and spectators, be-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing themselves unaccustomed to scenes of 
        			<lb/>this kind, can best describe the anguish of 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>mind and emotions of passion excited by 
        			<lb/>it! The loss of the Americans was small 
        			<lb/>compared to the British. But view them 
        			<lb/>once tranquil and happy in the midst of 
        			<lb/>social and domestic compact. No music 
        			<lb/>more harsh than the note of the shepherd, 
        			<lb/>of friendship and innocent glee. With 
        			<lb/>the lark, each morn was welcomed, as a 
        			<lb/>prelude to new joy and satisfaction.—Now 
        			<lb/>behold the reverse of the scene! As if na-
        			<lb break="no"/>ture had been convulsed, and with just in-
        			<lb break="no"/>dignation had frowned on some unpardon-
        			<lb break="no"/>able offence, their peace, and every social 
        			<lb/>and private endearment was, at once, 
        			<lb/>broken up. But <emph style="font-style: italic">she</emph> stands acquitted; 
        			<lb/>whilst the <emph style="font-style: italic">pride</emph> of <emph style="font-style: italic">man</emph> could be satiated on-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly with the dear price of the <emph style="font-style: italic">scourge</emph>—the 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">havoc</emph> of <emph style="font-style: italic">war</emph>. On that fatal day, when 
        			<lb/>their fields and streets, which had so 
        			<lb/>often re-echoed with rural felicity, sudden-
        		    <lb break="no"/>ly assumed the aspect of the regular <seg xml:id="a037" corresp="#n037"><emph style="font-style: italic">batta-

        			<lb/>of war, and the agonies of expiring rela-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>tives and friends, the <placeName>Earth</placeName> seemed to pre-
        			<lb break="no"/>cipitate her diurnal revolution, and to leave 
        			<lb/>the Sun in frightful aspect. The shepherds’ 
        			<lb/>flocks stood aghast. Birds forgot to carol, 
        			<lb/>and hastened away with astonished mute-
        			<lb break="no"/>ness. And think—while the tender <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph> 
        			<lb/>breast turned from the scene in distraction, 
        			<lb/>how it must have humanized the most sav-
        			<lb break="no"/>age temper, and have melted it into sym-
        			<lb break="no"/>pathy, even towards a relentless enemy.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE news of this battle spread with the 
        			<lb/>rapidity of a meteor. All <placeName>America</placeName> was 
        			<lb/>roused. And many companies of militia, 
        			<lb/>from remote parts, marched day and night, 
        			<lb/>almost without intermission, to the relief 
        			<lb/>of their friends in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. Thus, 
        			<lb/>in a short time, the environs of <placeName>Boston</placeName> ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>hibited, to the view of the enemy, the for-
        			<lb break="no"/>midable appearance of 20,000 men.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THIS event had the same effect on the 
        			<lb/>mind of <persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName>, as it had on those 
        			<lb/>of every one, that was <emph style="font-style: italic">awake</emph> to the intro-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>duction of objects so interesting and impor-
        			<lb break="no"/>tant; and whose feelings were ready to com-
        			<lb break="no"/>miserate the sufferings of any of the human 
        			<lb/>race.

        			<lb/>by that of <placeName>Breed’s Hill</placeName> in <placeName>Charlestown, Mas-

        			THE <date when="1775-06-16">16th of this month</date>, a detachment 
        			<lb/>of Provincials under the command of 
        		    <lb/><persName>Col. PRESCOTT</persName>, was ordered to <seg xml:id="a039" corresp="#n039">intrench</seg><note xml:id="n039" corresp="#a039"><term style="font-style: italic">Intrench</term>: dig and occupy trenches.</note> 
        			<lb/>on <placeName>Bunker’s Hill</placeName> the ensuing night. By 
        			<lb/>some mistake, <emph style="font-style: italic"><placeName>Breed’s Hill</placeName></emph> was marked out 
        			<lb/>for the intrenchment, instead of <emph style="font-style: italic"><placeName>Bunker’s</placeName>:</emph> 
        			<lb/>It being high and large like it, and on the 
        			<lb/>furthermost part of the peninsula next to 
        			<lb/><placeName>Boston</placeName>. They were prevented going to 
        			<lb/>work till midnight. They then pursued 
        			<lb/>their business with alacrity: And so pro-
        			<lb break="no"/>found was their silence, that they were not 
        			<lb/>heard by the British on board their vessels 
        			<lb/>lying in the harbour. At day-break, they 
        		    <lb/>had thrown up a small <seg xml:id="a040" corresp="#n040">redoubt;</seg><note xml:id="n040" corresp="#a040"><term style="font-style: italic">Redoubt</term>: an entrenched fortification.</note> which 
        			<lb/>was no sooner noticed by the Lively, a 
        			<lb/>man of war, than her cannon gave them a 
        			<lb/>very heavy salute.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE firing immediately rouzed the Brit-
        			<lb break="no"/>ish camp in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, and their fleet to be-
        			<lb break="no"/>hold a novelty they had little expected. 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>This diverted their attention from a 
        			<lb/>scheme they meant to have prosecuted the 
        			<lb/>next day; which was now called to drive 
        			<lb/>the Americans from the hill.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        		    NOTWITHSTANDING an incessant <seg xml:id="a041" corresp="#n041">can-

        			<lb/>continued laborious till noon, with the 
        			<lb/>loss of only one man. By some surprising 
        			<lb/>oversight, one detachment had labored, in-
        			<lb break="no"/>cessantly, four hours, with being re-
        			<lb break="no"/>lieved, or supplied with any refreshment.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BY this time the Americans had thrown

        			<lb break="no"/>pleting it by the intolerable fire of the en-
        			<lb break="no"/>emy.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			JUST after twelve o’clock, the day fair 
        			<lb/>and excessively hot, a great number of 
        			<lb/>boats and barges were filled with regular 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>troops and apparatus, who sail to <placeName>Charles-
        				<lb break="no"/>town</placeName>. The Generals, <persName>HOWE</persName> and <persName>PIGOT</persName>, 
        			<lb/>take the command. After they were land-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed, they form, and remain in that position, 
        			<lb/>till they are joined by another detachment, 
        		    <lb/>consisting of infantry, <seg xml:id="a044" corresp="#n044">grenadiers</seg><note xml:id="n044" corresp="#a044"><term style="font-style: italic">Grenadiers</term>: a soldier trained to throw grenades.</note> and ma-
        			<lb break="no"/>rines; which make in all, about 3,000.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			DURING these operations, the Generals, 
        			<lb/><persName>WARREN</persName> and <persName>POMEROY</persName>, join the Ameri-
        			<lb break="no"/>can force. <persName>General PUTNAM</persName> continues 
        			<lb/>ambitious in giving aid as occasion re-
        			<lb break="no"/>quires. They are ordered to take up a 
        			<lb/>post and rail fence, and to set it not quite 
        			<lb/>contiguous to another, and to fill the vacan-
        			<lb break="no"/>cy with some newly mown grass, as a slight 
        			<lb/>defence to the musketry of the enemy. 
        			<lb/>They are impatiently waiting the attack.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			In <placeName>Boston</placeName>, the Generals, <persName>CLINTON</persName> and 
        			<lb/><persName>BURGOYNE</persName>, had taken their stand on <placeName>Cop’s 
        				<lb/>Hill</placeName> to contemplate the bloody operations 
        			<lb/>now commencing. <persName>General GAGE</persName> had 
        			<lb/>previously determined, when any works 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>should be raised in <placeName>Charlestown</placeName> by the A-
        			<lb break="no"/>mericans, to burn the town: and whilst 
        			<lb/>his troops were advancing nearer to the 
        			<lb/>American lines, orders came to <placeName>Cop’s Hill</placeName> 
        			<lb/>for the execution of the resolution. Ac-
        		    <lb break="no"/>cordingly, a <seg xml:id="a045" corresp="#n045">carcass</seg><note xml:id="n045" corresp="#a045"><term style="font-style: italic">Carcass</term>: an incendiary missile.</note> was discharged, which 
        			<lb/>sat fire to the hither part of the town; which, 
        			<lb/>being fired in other parts by men for that 
        			<lb/>purpose, was, in a few minutes, in a gen-
        			<lb break="no"/>eral flame.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			WHAT scenes are now before us! There, 
        			<lb/>a handsome town, containing 300 houses, 
        			<lb/>and about 200 other buildings, wrapt in 
        			<lb/>one general conflagration; whose curling 
        			<lb/>flames and sable smoke, towering to the 
        			<lb/>clouds, seem to bespeak heavy vengeance 
        			<lb/>and destruction! In <placeName>Boston</placeName>, see the hous-
        			<lb break="no"/>es, piazzas and other heights crowded with 
        			<lb/>the anxious inhabitants, and those of the 
        			<lb/>British soldiery, who are not called upon 
        			<lb/>duty! Yonder, the adjacent hills and 
        			<lb/>fields are lined with Americans of both 
        			<lb/>sexes, and of all ages and orders. Now 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>turn to the American lines and intrench-
        			<lb break="no"/>ments. Behold them facing the most for-
        			<lb break="no"/>midable enemy, who are advancing towards 
        			<lb/>them with solemn and majestic dignity! 
        			<lb/>In a few moments, must be exhibited the 
        			<lb/>most horrid and affecting scene, that man-
        			<lb break="no"/>kind are capable of producing!
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ALTHOUGH the Americans are ill sup-
        		    <lb break="no"/>plied with <seg xml:id="a046" corresp="#n046">stores;</seg><note xml:id="n046" corresp="#a046"><term style="font-style: italic">Stores</term>: supplies, in this case food and ammunition.</note> and many of their 
        			<lb/>muskets without bayonets; yet they are 
        			<lb/>generally good marksmen, being accus-
        			<lb break="no"/>tomed to hunting. The British move 
        			<lb/>on slowly, instead of a quick step. The 
        		    <lb/><seg xml:id="a047" corresp="#n047">provincials</seg><note xml:id="n047" corresp="#a047"><term style="font-style: italic">Provincials</term>: American troops.</note> are ordered to reserve their 
        			<lb/>fire, till the troops advance within ten or 
        			<lb/>twelve rods; when they begin a tremen-
        			<lb break="no"/>dous discharge of musketry, which is re-
        			<lb break="no"/>turned by the enemy, for a few minutes, 
        			<lb/>without advancing a yard. But the stream 
        			<lb/>of American fire is so incessant and does 
        			<lb/>such astonishing execution, that the regu-
        			<lb break="no"/>lars break and fall back in confusion. 
        			<lb/>They are again with difficulty rallied; but 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>march with apparent reluctance to the in-
        			<lb break="no"/>trenchments. The Americans at the re-
        			<lb break="no"/>doubt, and those who are attacked by the 
        			<lb/>British infantry in their lines leading from 
        			<lb/>it to the water, are ordered, as usual, to re-
        			<lb break="no"/>serve their fire.—The fence proves a poor 
        			<lb/>shelter: and many are much more expos-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed than necessity obliges. So that the Brit-
        			<lb break="no"/>ish cannot, in future, stigmatize them with 
        			<lb/>the name of <term style="font-style: italic">cowards</term>, who will fly at the 
        			<lb/>sight of a <emph style="font-style: italic">grenadier’s cap</emph>, nor for fighting in 
        			<lb/>an unfair manner. They wait till the ene-
        			<lb break="no"/>my is within six rods; when the earth again 
        			<lb/>trembles with their fire. The enemy are 
        			<lb/>mown down in ranks, and again are repul-
        			<lb break="no"/>sed. <persName>General CLINTON</persName> observes this, and 
        			<lb/>passes over from <placeName>Boston</placeName> without waiting 
        			<lb/>for orders. The British officers are heard 
        			<lb/>to say, “<hi rend="italic">It is downright butchery to lead the 
        				<lb/>troops on afresh to the lines</hi>.” But their <emph style="font-style: italic">honor</emph> 
        			<lb/>is at stake; and the attack is again attempted. 
        			<lb/>The officers are seen to use the most vio-
        			<lb break="no"/>lent gestures with their swords to rally their 
        			<lb/>troops: and though there is an almost insu-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>perable aversion in them to renew the attack, 
        			<lb/>the officers are once more successful.—
        			<lb/>The Americans are in want of ammunition, 
        			<lb/>but cannot procure any. Whilst they are 
        			<lb/>ordered to retreat within the fort, the ene-
        			<lb break="no"/>my make a decisive push: the officers goad 
        			<lb/>on the soldiers with their swords—redou-
        			<lb break="no"/>ble their fire on all sides; and the redoubt 
        			<lb/>is attacked on three sides at once. The 
        			<lb/>Americans are, unavoidably, ordered to 
        			<lb/>retreat: But they delay, and fight with the 
        			<lb/>butt end of their guns, till the redoubt is 
        			<lb/>two-thirds filled with regular troops.—In 
        			<lb/>their retreat, which led over a neck lead-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing from <placeName>Cambridge</placeName> to <placeName>Charlestown</placeName>, they 
        			<lb/>were again in the greatest jeopardy of be-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing cut off by the <placeName>Glasgow</placeName> man of war, 
        			<lb/>floating batteries, &amp;c. But they effected 
        			<lb/>it without much loss, and with greater reg-
        			<lb break="no"/>ularity than could be expected from men, 
        			<lb/>who had never before seen an engagement. 
        			<lb/><persName>General WARREN</persName>, being in the rear, was 
        			<lb/>shot in the back part of his head; and ha-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>ving clapped his hand to the wound, drop-
        			<lb break="no"/>ped down dead.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE number of Americans engaged, in-
        			<lb break="no"/>cluding those who dared to cross the Neck 
        			<lb/>and join them, was only 1500. Their loss 
        			<lb/>was small compared with the British. 
        			<lb/>The killed, wounded and missing were 453; 
        			<lb/>of which, 139 were slain. Of the British, 
        			<lb/>the killed and wounded were 1054; of 
        			<lb/>which, 226 were killed.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IT has been said by a veteran officer, 
        			<lb/>who was at the battles of <placeName>Dettingen</placeName>, <placeName>Min-
        				<lb break="no"/>den</placeName>, and several others, in <placeName>Germany</placeName>—that 
        			<lb/>for the time it lasted, he never knew any-
        			<lb break="no"/>thing equal it. The British displayed 
        			<lb/>great heroic bravery: And there was a per-
        			<lb break="no"/>petual sheet of fire from the Americans for 
        			<lb/>half an hour; and the action was intensely 
        			<lb/>hot for double that time.

        		<p>
        			AMONG the slain of the British, they par-

        			    <lb/><choice><sic>ABBERCOMBY</sic><corr>ABERCROMBY</corr></choice></persName>, and <persName>Major PITCAIRN</persName>, who 
        			<lb/>occasioned the first shedding of blood at 
        			<lb/><placeName>Lexington</placeName>. Among the Americans, we 
        			<lb/>lament, in particular, the fall of <persName>General 
        				<lb/>WARREN</persName>, the Colonels <persName>GARDNER</persName>, <persName>PAR-
        					<lb break="no"/>KER</persName>, <persName>CHELMSFORD</persName>, &amp;c. But the fall of 
        			<lb/><persName>General WARREN</persName> is the most effectually 
        			<lb/>felt. By his fall, the public sustain the loss 
        			<lb/>of the warm patriot and politician, the emi-
        			<lb break="no"/>nent orator and physician; with which 
        			<lb/>were blended the other endearing and or-
        			<lb break="no"/>namental accomplishments. And though 
        			<lb/>an amiable consort and a number of small 
        			<lb/>children had rendered his existence more 
        			<lb/>desirable; he distinguished himself <emph style="font-style: italic">this day</emph>, 
        			<lb/>by fighting as a <emph style="font-style: italic">volunteer</emph>; and fell an illus-
        			<lb break="no"/>trious EXAMPLE in the CAUSE of LIBERTY 
        			<lb/>and the RIGHTS of MAN.

        			ABOUT this time the country inhabi-
        			<lb break="no"/>tants, near <placeName>Boston</placeName>, were frequently alarm-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed by idle and ignorant reports, that the 
        			<lb/>British troops had broken through the A-
        			<lb break="no"/>merican lines, were penetrating, with the 
        			<lb/>greatest rapidity into the country, rava-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>ging, plundering and butchering all be-
        			<lb break="no"/>fore them. And more than once, was 
        			<lb/><persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName> persuaded to join her fe-
        			<lb break="no"/>male circle, who were as ignorant of what 
        			<lb/>passed in the armies as herself, to seek secu-
        			<lb break="no"/>rity in the dreary desert, or deserted cot-
        			<lb break="no"/>tage. But she peculiarly noted the day of 
        			<lb/><placeName>Breed’s Hill</placeName> engagement, as did many oth-
        			<lb break="no"/>ers, by the incessant roar of the cannon. 
        			<lb/>A fertile eminence, near which she lived, 
        			<lb/>is a standing monument of the pensive 
        			<lb/>thoughts and reflections she experienced 
        			<lb/>during the melancholy day. She has said, 
        			<lb/>that, for some days after the battle, having 
        			<lb/>had an account of it, sleep was a stranger 
        			<lb/>to her. It seems, her attention was of a 
        			<lb/>different nature from that of many of 
        			<lb/>her sex and youth. Whilst they were 
        			<lb/>only dreading the <emph style="font-style: italic">consequences</emph>, she was ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>ploring the <emph style="font-style: italic">cause</emph> of the eruption. This, 
        			<lb/>as she had heard, or naturally apprehend-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed would terminate, at least, in <placeName>New-Eng-
        				<lb break="no"/>land’s</placeName> wretchedness or glory.

        			IT is, indeed, too much to sport with the 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">lives</emph> of any animals. But when a large 
        			<lb/>number of <emph style="font-style: italic">men</emph>, many of whom, perhaps, 
        			<lb/>are involuntarily led into the field, and 
        			<lb/>many more, without knowing or caring for 
        			<lb/>what reason,—march within a few paces of

        			<lb/>fairer <emph style="font-style: italic">mark</emph> for the <emph style="font-style: italic">sport</emph> of the avarice, pride 
        			<lb/>and ambition of a few licenced incendiaries
        			<lb/>—<emph style="font-style: italic">nature</emph> must recoil, or the whole system of

        			SHE had frequent opportunity of view-

        			<lb/>was opened for the hero, politician and

        			<lb/>even to the philosophic moralist. The 
        			<lb/>consequence of which, was the declaration of our

        			<lb/>every votary of <emph style="font-style: italic">American Freedom</emph>, it must

        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">sovereignty</emph> of our <emph style="font-style: italic">parent country</emph>: And sec-

        			I KNOW not that she ever was deserv-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing the name of <emph style="font-style: italic">fickleness</emph> in her pursuits; 
        			<lb/>yet, I have the strongest reason to con-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>clude, that her mind, during her juvenili-
        			<lb break="no"/>ty, was so crowded with inventive ideas for 
        			<lb/>improvements, as to throw it into uncom-

        			BEFORE this time, Congress had taken 
        			<lb/>effectual methods to encourage the manu-
        			<lb break="no"/>facture of our own apparel, and every 
        			<lb/>other consumption in <placeName>America</placeName>. And the 
        			<lb/>reflection is pleasing, that <persName>Mr. THOMAS’s</persName> 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>family was not the only one who had not 
        			<lb/>the reformation to begin. As though they 
        			<lb/>had always been apprehensive of the utili-
        			<lb break="no"/>ty and honor they should gain by it, they 
        			<lb/>had always practised it; and the voice of 
        			<lb/>Congress was only a stimulation: So that 
        			<lb/><persName>Miss SAMPSON’s</persName> employments were not 
        			<lb/>much altered. And she has, somewhere, 
        			<lb/>suggested—that had we continued this most 
        			<lb/>laudable and ever recommendable employ-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment, in the same degree, to this day, we 
        			<lb/>should not only have increased commerce 
        			<lb/>with many foreign nations; but, have re-
        			<lb break="no"/>tained immense sums of money, which are 
        			<lb/>now piled shining <emph style="font-style: italic">monuments</emph> of the opu-
        			<lb break="no"/>lence of other nations, and of our own <emph style="font-style: italic">van-
        				<lb break="no"/>ity</emph> and <emph style="font-style: italic">inattention</emph>. In this opinion, I am 
        				<lb/>confident, every well-wisher to his coun-
        		    <lb break="no"/>try is still ready to <seg xml:id="a051" corresp="#n051">concur.</seg><note xml:id="n051" corresp="#a051"><persName>MISS SAMPSON</persName> has just shown me pieces of lawn and muslin which were manufactured with her own hands, soon after the commencement of the war. I consider them as nothing more than specimens of Columbian abilities, genius and taste. It is wounding to me to hear—“We can buy cheaper than we can make.” No doubt—And so long as we encourage foreign manufacture by sending them our specie, there is no doubt, but they can sell cheaper than we can make. And even when they have entirely drained us of our money, there will be one cheerful certainty left—they will laugh at our credulity. [Note in original.]</note>

        			<lb/>friend, having taught us the advantages of 
        			<lb/>our own manufactures for the support and 
        			<lb/>conveniences of life, continued still favor-
        			<lb break="no"/>able to our intellectual powers, and prompt-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed them to the study of arts and sciences. 
        			<lb/>The propriety of this is ratified by our In-

        			<lb/>only one, who realized it: But she has of-

        			<lb/>or may have, the same propensities for it, 
        			<lb/>may have freer access to it. Her situation of 
        			<lb/>mind was very applicable to the maxim—
        			<lb/>“<term style="font-style: italic">Learning has no enemy but ignorance</term>.” She 
        			<lb/>was not now of age; but she resolved, 
        			<lb/>when that period should arrive, to devise 
        			<lb/>some more effectual method to attain it.

        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>less, was the case with many good people 
        			<lb/>in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, after the seat of war was 
        			<lb/>removed to distant parts; when they were 
        			<lb/>not so suddenly alarmed by its havoc. To 
        			<lb/>whatever degree this may have been the 
        			<lb/>case with <persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName>, it appears, that its 
        			<lb/>first impressions, instead of being obliter-
        			<lb break="no"/>ated by time, were more strongly impressed 
        			<lb/>on her mind. In fact, it seems, she only 
        			<lb/>needed a different formation to have de-
        			<lb break="no"/>monstrated in <emph style="font-style: italic">actions</emph> what she was obliged 
        			<lb/>to conceal through restraint of nature and 
        			<lb/>custom. 
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			JUST before she was eighteen, <date when="1779">1779</date>, she 
        			<lb/>was employed, much to her liking, six 
        			<lb/>months in the warm season, in teaching a 
        			<lb/>public school in <placeName>Middleborough</placeName>. In this 
        			<lb/>business, experience more effectually con-
        			<lb break="no"/>vinced her, that her <emph style="font-style: italic">education</emph>, rather than 
        			<lb/>her <emph style="font-style: italic">endowments</emph>, was inadequate to the task. 
        			<lb/>But her success more than equalled her 
        			<lb/>expectations, both with regard to the profi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ciency of her pupils, and the approbation 
        			<lb/>of her employers.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			THE next season her engagement was re-
        			<lb break="no"/>newed for the same term in the same school. 
        			<lb/>She now found her talk easier, and her 
        			<lb/>success greater, having had the advantage 
        			<lb/>of a good man school the preceding win-
        			<lb break="no"/>ter. The employment was very agreeable 
        			<lb/>to her; especially, as it was a source of 
        			<lb/>much improvement to herself.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			NOT far from this time, there began to 
        			<lb/>be an uncommon <emph style="font-style: italic">agitation</emph> among many 
        			<lb/>people in her neighborhood; as had been, 
        			<lb/>or soon followed, in many towns in <placeName>New-
        				<lb/>England</placeName>. This penetrating disorder was 
        			<lb/>not confined to old age. It violently seiz-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed on the middle-aged, and as she remark-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed, even <emph style="font-style: italic">children</emph> caught the contagion. 
        			<lb/>There are but few mischiefs, that <emph style="font-style: italic">war</emph> is not 
        			<lb/>capable of effecting.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BUT some well-minded people were 
        			<lb/>ready to term this <emph style="font-style: italic">the working of the Spirit, 
        				<lb/>of the Holy Ghost—a reformation in religion</emph>. 
        			<lb/>Whether it originated from the unusual 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>and influential exertions of the clergy, who 
        			<lb/>took advantage of this unparalleled crisis 
        			<lb/>to add to their number of converts in the 
        			<lb/>Christian religion; or, whether it was a 
        		    <lb/>voluntary act of the mind, or a natural <seg xml:id="a052" corresp="#n052">ca-
        		        <lb break="no"/>chexy;</seg><note xml:id="n052" corresp="#a052"><term style="font-style: italic">Cachexy</term>: depravity.</note>—or whether it is a characteristic 
        			<lb/>trait of the <emph style="font-style: italic">Divine Character</emph>—I have not 
        			<lb/>time here to conjecture.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			SHE was in the midst of it, and was excit-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed to observe its operations. But <emph style="font-style: italic">she</emph> had 
        			<lb/>the wise precaution to study well its pur-
        			<lb break="no"/>port, rather than to suffer the <emph style="font-style: italic">fugitive</emph> to 
        			<lb/>take her by surprise. But let its ten-
        			<lb break="no"/>dency have been what it might, it an-
        			<lb break="no"/>swered a good purpose for her. It served 
        			<lb/>to rouze her attention; and to bring a-
        			<lb break="no"/>bout these important enquiries:—From 
        			<lb/>whence came man? What is his busi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ness? And for what is he designed? She 
        			<lb/>considered herself as having been too 
        			<lb/>inattentive to religion; which, as she 
        			<lb/>had been taught, and naturally conceived, 
        			<lb/>is the most indispensable duty enjoined on 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>man, both with regard to his <emph style="font-style: italic">well-being 
        				<lb/>here</emph>, and to the <emph style="font-style: italic">eternal welfare</emph> of his im-
        			<lb break="no"/>mortal part.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BUT from her best conclusive argu-
        			<lb break="no"/>ments drawn from a contest of this nature, 
        			<lb/>she saw no propriety in it. Reason being 
        			<lb/>perverted or obstructed in its course, the 
        			<lb/>whole system of intellects is thrown into a 
        			<lb/>delirium. This being the case, as she con-
        			<lb break="no"/>ceived, in this <emph style="font-style: italic">outcry</emph> of <emph style="font-style: italic">religion;</emph> its subjects 
        				<lb/>were of course, not only disqualified for 
        			<lb/>useful business, which was, certainly, want-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed at that time, if ever, but rendered to-
        			<lb break="no"/>tally incapacitated for the adoration and 
        			<lb/>worship of DEITY, in a manner becoming 
        			<lb/>his dignity, or the dictates of sound reason.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			AT this age, she had not, professionally, 
        			<lb/>united herself to any religious denomina-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion; as was the practice of many of her 
        			<lb/>cotemporaries. She considered herself in 
        			<lb/>a state of probation, and a free agent; and 
        			<lb/>consequently at liberty, to select her own 
        			<lb/>religion. In this, she was, in a measure, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>mistaken. Had her mind been free from 
        			<lb/>the manacles of <emph style="font-style: italic">custom</emph>, and unswayed by 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">education</emph>, she might have boasted of an ad-
        			<lb break="no"/>vantage superior to all others, and might, 
        			<lb/>peradventure, have entertained the world 
        			<lb/>with a set of opinions, different from all 
        			<lb/>other sects and nations. But these were her 
        			<lb/>combatants. As she advanced on the stage 
        			<lb/>of life to establish a religion, her prospect 
        			<lb/>was that of the <emph style="font-style: italic">Christian world:</emph> And her 
        			<lb/>assent to it was at once urged by her mode 
        			<lb/>of education. Indeed, this was the only 
        			<lb/>religion of which she had any knowledge, 
        			<lb/>except that which simple <emph style="font-style: italic">nature</emph> always 
        			<lb/>teaches.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BUT her researches in Christianity did 
        			<lb/>not occasion so much surprise to its vota-
        			<lb break="no"/>ries as they did to herself. On examina-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion, instead of finding only <emph style="font-style: italic">one</emph> denomina-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion, she must have been entertained—
        			<lb/>more probably, alarmed, on finding almost 
        			<lb/>an infinite number of sects which had 
        			<lb/>sprung out of it, and in each sectary a dif-
        			<lb break="no"/>ferent opinion—all right, infallibly right, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>in their own estimation. A great diversity 
        			<lb/>of scenery in the same drama, or tragedy, 
        			<lb/>upon the stage, perhaps has nothing in it 
        			<lb/>wonderful or criminal. But a religion, 
        			<lb/>which is believed to be of divine origin, 
        			<lb/>even communicated directly from GOD to 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">Man</emph>, consequently, intended for the equal 
        			<lb/>good of all, but still subject to controver-
        			<lb break="no"/>sy—differently construed and differently 
        			<lb/>practised—she conceived, has every thing of 
        			<lb/>the marvellous, if not of an inconsistent 
        			<lb/>nature. Thus, when she would attach her-
        			<lb break="no"/>self to <emph style="font-style: italic">one</emph>, the sentiments of a <emph style="font-style: italic">second</emph> would 
        			<lb/>prevail, and those of a <emph style="font-style: italic">third</emph> would stagnate 
        			<lb/>her choice: and for a while she was tempt-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed to reject the whole, till thorough exa-
        			<lb break="no"/>mination and the aid of HIM, who cannot 
        			<lb/>err, should determine the best. And I am 
        			<lb/>not certain, there are not many, who have 
        			<lb/>made their profession, who ought to disap-
        			<lb break="no"/>prove her resolution.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			TO have called in question the validity 
        			<lb/>and authenticity of the Scriptures would 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>only have been challenging, at least, one 
        			<lb/>half <placeName>America</placeName>, and a quarter of the rest of 
        			<lb/>the globe to immediate combat: For which 
        			<lb/>she had neither abilities, nor inclination. 
        			<lb/>She began to reflect, however, that, the be-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing bound to any set religion, by the force 
        			<lb/>of man, would not only be an infraction 
        			<lb/>of the laws of <emph style="font-style: italic">Nature</emph>, but a striking and 
        			<lb/>effectual blow at the prime root of that <emph style="font-style: italic">lib-
        				<lb break="no"/>erty</emph>, for which our nation was then con-
        			<lb break="no"/>tending.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			I WOULD not leave the public to surmise, 
        			<lb/>that she derived no advantage from Chris-
        			<lb break="no"/>tianity. Though divines utterly disallow, 
        			<lb/>that the plan of the Gospel can be attained 
        			<lb/>by the dim light of nature, or by the boasted 
        			<lb/>schools of philosophy; yet, we have al-
        			<lb break="no"/>ready found in these MEMOIRS, that, as 
        			<lb/>feeble as they are, they lead, without equi-
        			<lb break="no"/>vocation, to the knowledge and belief of 
        			<lb/>DEITY, who, every one acknowledges, is 
        			<lb/>the first and great object of our reverence 
        			<lb/>and devotion. Christian morality, she ac-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>knowledges with more warmth, than I have 
        			<lb/>known in many, who have had greater ad-
        			<lb break="no"/>vantages of education. Setting aside the 
        			<lb/>doctrines of <term style="font-style: italic">total depravity</term>, <term style="font-style: italic">election</term>, and a 
        			<lb/>few others, which were always inadmissible 
        			<lb/>by her reason, she is an adherent to its 
        			<lb/>creed. By her diffidence, she is willing, 
        			<lb/>however, that her ignorance should be so 
        			<lb/>far exposed to the public, as to declare, 
        			<lb/>that she knows not whether it is more from 
        			<lb/>the <emph style="font-style: italic">light</emph> of <emph style="font-style: italic">Gospel revelation</emph>, or the <emph style="font-style: italic">force</emph> 
        			<lb/>of education, that she is led to the assent of 
        			<lb/>the fundamental doctrines of Christianity.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THIS view of her religious sentiments 
        			<lb/>will be concluded by the following summa-
        			<lb break="no"/>ry of what she now believes to be genuine 
        			<lb/>religion: And under whatever denomina-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion it may fall, it must always continue 
        			<lb/>without a precedent.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THAT religion, which has a tendency to 
        			<lb/>give us the greatest and most direct knowl-
        			<lb break="no"/>edge of DEITY, of his attributes and works, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>and of our duty to HIM, to ourselves and 
        			<lb/>to all the human race, is the truest and best; 
        			<lb/>and by which, only, we can have <emph style="font-style: italic">consciences 
        				<lb/>void of offence</emph>.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			I TAKE the liberty to close this chapter 
        			<lb/>with a few digressional remarks.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			SENSIBLE I am, that when we can be 
        			<lb/>made sensible that religion, in its truest 
        			<lb/>sense, ought to be made the ultimate end 
        			<lb/>and object of our pursuit—that it is the 
        			<lb/>greatest requisite for our general felicity, 
        			<lb/>both here and in futurity;—or, should it be 
        			<lb/>found, that, as we disregard, or attend to 
        			<lb/>it, our temporal interest will be effected, as 
        			<lb/>it is by our legislative government—I am 
        			<lb/>inclined to believe, not a mystery, or hidden 
        			<lb/>part in it will long remain unexplored, 
        			<lb/>but established or rejected, as it may be 
        			<lb/>deemed genuine. Civil government and 
        			<lb/>religion have, briefly, this difference:—
        			<lb/>Civil government serves as a directory ne-
        			<lb break="no"/>cessary for the accumulation and preserva-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion of temporal interest and conveniencies 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>for life: religion teaches us how to set a 
        			<lb/>proper estimate on them, and on all other 
        			<lb/>enjoyments in life. It expands and ele-
        			<lb break="no"/>vates the mind to a sense and knowledge 
        			<lb/>of DEITY, and to the dignity of human na-
        			<lb break="no"/>ture. It pervades the whole soul, and fills 
        			<lb/>it with light and love. It is a source, from 
        			<lb/>which, only, can be derived permanent sa-
        			<lb break="no"/>tisfaction, and teaches us the true end of 
        			<lb/>our existence. For want of a knowledge 
        			<lb/>or realization of this, into how many gross 
        			<lb/>errors and absurdities have mankind inad-
        			<lb break="no"/>vertently fallen, or inattentively been led: 
        			<lb/>When impositions of this kind have been 
        			<lb/>multiplied upon them, when they have been 
        			<lb/>stigmatized by this name, or by that, in 
        			<lb/>matters of sentiment; it seems, they have 
        			<lb/>rested comfortably easy, without enquiring 
        			<lb/>into their truth or justice, or passed them 
        			<lb/>off with flighty indifference. But touch 
        			<lb/>our <emph style="font-style: italic">interest</emph>—that bright, momentary gem! 
        			<lb/>the cheek is immediately flushed, and the 
        			<lb/>whole heart and head are upon the rack—
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>set to invention for redress. So contract-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed and interwoven with lucrative, fan-
        			<lb break="no"/>tastical gain are the views and pursuits of 
        			<lb/>men.

        			FROM the maturity of her years, observa-

        			<lb/>possession of <emph style="font-style: italic">Liberty</emph> in its truest sense and

        			<lb/>that adorn the nations of the <placeName>earth</placeName>.

        		<p>
        			THIS, and her propensities for an ac-
        			<lb break="no"/>quaintance with the geography of her coun-
        			<lb break="no"/>try, were, alternately, severe in her mind. 
        			<lb/>Her taste for geography must have been 
        			<lb/>chiefly spontaneous; as the study of it in 
        			<lb/>books was unfashionable among the fe-
        		    <lb break="no"/>male <seg xml:id="a055" corresp="#n055">yeomanry.</seg><note xml:id="n055" corresp="#a055"><term style="font-style: italic">Yeomanry</term>: small landowning proprietors, small farmers.</note>—I am happy to remar5 
        			<lb/>here, that this useful and delightsome sci-
        			<lb break="no"/>ence is now become a polite accomplish-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment for ladies.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IT was now a crisis with her not often to 
        			<lb/>be experienced: and though it was painful 
        			<lb/>to bear, it was, doubtless, conducive to 
        			<lb/>improvement. Invention being upon the 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>rack, every wheel in the machine is put in 
        			<lb/>motion, and some event must follow. It 
        			<lb/>produced many pertinent thoughts on the 
        			<lb/>education of her sex. Very justly did she 
        			<lb/>consider the female sphere of action, in many 
        			<lb/>respects too contracted; in others, wanting 
        			<lb/>limits. In general she deemed their <emph style="font-style: italic">oppor-
        				<lb break="no"/>tunities</emph>, rather than <emph style="font-style: italic">abilities</emph>, inadequate for 
        				<lb/>those departments in science and the belles-
        			<lb/>lettres, in which they are so peculiarly calcu-
        			<lb break="no"/>lated to shine.—From this, let me infer 
        			<lb/>that, although <emph style="font-style: italic">custom</emph> constitutes the gener-
        			<lb break="no"/>al <emph style="font-style: italic">standard</emph> of female education; yet, the 
        			<lb/>best method that occurs to my mind to be 
        			<lb/>used in this important business, is that dic-
        			<lb break="no"/>tated by reason and convenience.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BUT the public must here be surprised in 
        			<lb/>the contemplation of the machinations and 
        			<lb/>achievements of <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph> heroism and virtue: 
        		    <lb/>which if not the most <choice><sic>unparralleled</sic><corr>unparalleled</corr></choice>, are the 
        			<lb/>most singular, that have ever sprung out of 
        			<lb/><persName>Columbia’s</persName> soil. And it is but reasonable, 
        			<lb/>that we exercise all that candor and chari-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>ty, that the nature of the circumstances 
        			<lb/>will admit. By ideally putting ourselves 
        			<lb/>in similar circumstances, the reasonable-
        			<lb break="no"/>ness will be fully evinced. Though inde-
        			<lb break="no"/>pendent and free, <emph style="font-style: italic">custom</emph> in many respects 
        			<lb/>rules us with despotic sway: And the per-
        			<lb break="no"/>son who greatly deviates from it, exposes 
        			<lb/>himself to numberless dangers. An indel-
        			<lb break="no"/>ible stigma may doom him to infamy; 
        			<lb/>though perhaps, his original design was to 
        			<lb/>effect some useful and important event. 
        			<lb/>But on the other hand, <emph style="font-style: italic">liberty</emph> gives us such 
        			<lb/>ascendancy over old <emph style="font-style: italic">habit</emph>, that unless it 
        			<lb/>bind us to some apparent and permanent 
        			<lb/>good, its iron bands are subject to dissolu-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion. We have, in some measure seen 
        			<lb/><persName>Miss SAMPSON’s</persName> motives for achievement; 
        			<lb/>the rest will be illustrated in the sequel.

        		    HAVING come of age, her former <seg xml:id="a056" corresp="#n056">reso-
        		        <lb break="no"/>lution</seg><note xml:id="n056" corresp="#a056">SEE CHAP. IV. [Note in original.]</note> remained to be executed. For 
        			<lb/>this purpose, she planned many schemes 
        			<lb/>and fabricated many castles; but, on exam-
        			<pb/>
        		    <lb break="no"/>ination, found them <seg xml:id="a057" corresp="#n057">chimerical,</seg><note xml:id="n057" corresp="#a057"><term style="font-style: italic">Chimerical</term>: fanciful.</note> or of pre-
        			<lb break="no"/>carious foundation. Every recent infor-
        			<lb break="no"/>mation of the geography of the continent, 
        			<lb/>served only to stimulate propensities, 
        			<lb/>which she had no desire to stifle. But the 
        			<lb/>news of the war served but to engross her 
        			<lb/>mind with anxieties and emotions she had 
        			<lb/>long labored to suppress. And it must 
        			<lb/>here be mentioned to her honor, that she 
        			<lb/>used arguments <emph style="font-style: italic">for</emph>, and <emph style="font-style: italic">against</emph>, herself in 
        			<lb/>every important proposition drawn for en-
        			<lb break="no"/>terprise. Her chief problems for solution 
        			<lb/>may have been these:—Must I forever 
        			<lb/>counteract inclination and stay within the 
        			<lb/>compass of the smoke of my own chimney? 
        			<lb/>Never tread on different soils; nor form 
        			<lb/>an acquaintance with a greater circle of 
        			<lb/>the human race? Stifle that spirit of <emph style="font-style: italic">heroic 
        				<lb/>patriotism</emph>, which no one knows but HIM 
        			<lb/>who foreknows all events, but may termi-
        			<lb break="no"/>nate in the greatest good to myself, and 
        			<lb/>in some degree promote the CAUSE of my 
        			<lb/>COUNTRY? Yield the palm of <emph style="font-style: italic">custom</emph> to the 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">force</emph> of that <emph style="font-style: italic">philanthropy</emph>, which should 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>warm the bosoms of both sexes and all 
        			<lb/>ages?—In fact, shall I swerve from my sex’s 
        			<lb/>sphere for the sake of acquiring a little 
        			<lb/>useful acquisition; or, shall I submit (with-
        			<lb break="no"/>out reluctance, I cannot) to a prison, 
        			<lb/>where I must drag out the remainder of 
        			<lb/>my existence in ignorance: where the 
        			<lb/>thoughts of my too cloistered situation must 
        			<lb/>forever harrass my bosom with listless pur-
        			<lb break="no"/>suits, tasteless enjoyments and responsive 
        			<lb/>discontent?
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			CONTRASTING this argumentation with 
        			<lb/>the superior advantages of many of the hu-
        			<lb break="no"/>man race for acquiring knowledge, she 
        			<lb/>was ready, for a moment, to find fault with 
        			<lb/>her <emph style="font-style: italic">formation:</emph> but happily, it was but mo-
        			<lb break="no"/>mentary. As if she had been instantly 
        			<lb/>cured of a frenzy, she could scarcely be 
        			<lb/>reconciled with herself for such presump-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion. It being not only an indignity to 
        			<lb/>her own sex, but the basest ingratitude to 
        			<lb/>her MAKER, and derogatory to his laws. 
        			<lb/>Her humble solicitations were, that she 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>never might be so lost to all sense of virtue 
        			<lb/>and decorum, as to act a part unworthy her 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">being</emph>, thereby not only bring infamy on her-
        			<lb break="no"/>self, but leave a blemish and stigma on 
        			<lb/>the female world.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			FOR this purpose, she resolved to think 
        			<lb/>no more of projecting adventures, of leav-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing the tranquillity of her domestic retire-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment—her endearing circle of relations 
        			<lb/>and friends, to visit distant parts; as the 
        			<lb/>good she anticipated in the result was un-
        			<lb break="no"/>certain, and might, in a fatal manner, prove 
        			<lb/>fallacious. Her flights of imagination had 
        			<lb/>furnished a clue the most requisite for the 
        			<lb/>maxim, which every one more or less 
        			<lb/>needs—“<emph style="font-style: italic">When fancy rides, let reason hold the 
        				<lb/>reins</emph>.” She likewise resolved to suspend 
        			<lb/>all further enquiries and anxiety about the 
        			<lb/>war. Vain attempts! The prohibitions 
        			<lb/>proved a source of mortification and dis-
        			<lb break="no"/>content. And it seems, a prevention of 
        			<lb/>these enquiries would have been as much 
        			<lb/>impossible as it would to have brought the 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>war to a close without negotiation, or by 
        			<lb/>inaction itself. It seems, she could not 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">hear</emph> of its <emph style="font-style: italic">success</emph> without <emph style="font-style: italic">feeling</emph> the <emph style="font-style: italic">victory</emph>. 
        				<lb/>She had heard of many beautiful cities, rich 
        			<lb/>soils, healthy climates and different customs 
        			<lb/>with the inhabitants: And the thought of 
        			<lb/>being prohibited from augmenting her ac-
        			<lb break="no"/>quaintance with them, was but anticipating 
        			<lb/>her dissolution too soon.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IN this dilemma she continued several 
        			<lb/>months without any fixed resolution. At 
        			<lb/>length, her propensities for viewing distant 
        			<lb/>places, &amp;c. gained such a perfect ascend-
        			<lb break="no"/>ancy over cooler reason, that her propen-
        			<lb break="no"/>sities could brook no controul. She de-
        			<lb break="no"/>termined to burst the bands, which, it must 
        			<lb/>be confessed, have too often held her sex 
        			<lb/>in awe, and in some mode and measure, 
        			<lb/>stretch beyond the boundaries of her own 
        			<lb/>neighborhood; by which means she might 
        			<lb/>be convinced whether what she had read 
        			<lb/>or heard be true—“<emph style="font-style: italic">That one half of the 
        				<lb/>world does not know how the other half lives</emph>.” 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>But here fresh scenes of difficulties await-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed her: though many had been before an-
        			<lb break="no"/>ticipated. <persName>Prudence</persName>, as usual, appeared 
        			<lb/>in her plain, but neat, attire, and called her 
        			<lb/>resolution in question. Delicacy trimmed 
        			<lb/>her dislocated hair; and virtue brought 
        		    <lb/>her <seg xml:id="a058" corresp="#n058">amaranthine</seg><note xml:id="n058" corresp="#a058"><term style="font-style: italic">Amaranthine</term>: made of amaranths, a mythical flower said to never fade.</note> wreath. The thought of 
        			<lb/>travelling without a companion or protec-
        			<lb break="no"/>tor, was deemed by <emph style="font-style: italic">prudence</emph> a step of pre-
        			<lb break="no"/>sumption. Not to have travelled at all, 
        			<lb/>might have deprived her of much good, 
        			<lb/>with increasing anxiety: And there was 
        			<lb/>an avenue to it both ways. But her great-
        			<lb break="no"/>est obstacle was the want of that current 
        			<lb/>specie, which is always sure to gain the es-
        			<lb break="no"/>teem of all people. Without it, she must 
        			<lb/>have been liable to have incurred the ap-
        		    <lb break="no"/>pellation of an idler, a <seg xml:id="a059" corresp="#n059">bonaroba,</seg><note xml:id="n059" corresp="#a059"><term style="font-style: italic">Bonaroba</term>: a wanton woman.</note> or a 
        			<lb/>vagabond: And so have failed in her de-
        			<lb break="no"/>sign; which was the acquisition of knowl-
        			<lb break="no"/>edge without the loss of reputation.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			WHILST she was deliberating on these 
        			<lb/>matters, she privately dressed herself in a 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>handsome suit of man’s apparel and repair-
        		    <lb break="no"/>ed to a <seg xml:id="a060" corresp="#n060">prognosticator.</seg><note xml:id="n060" corresp="#a060"><term style="font-style: italic">Prognosticator</term>: like a <term style="font-style: italic">necromancer</term> (below), a fortune-teller.</note> This, she declares, 
        			<lb/>was not to stimulate, but to divert her in-
        			<lb break="no"/>clinations from objects which not only 
        			<lb/>seemed presumptuous, but impracticable. 
        			<lb/>She informed him, she had not come with 
        			<lb/>an intention to put entire confidence in 
        			<lb/>his delusory suggestions; but it was partly 
        			<lb/>out of principle, but mostly out of curiosi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ty. He considered her as a blithe and hon-
        			<lb break="no"/>est young gentleman. She heard his pre-
        			<lb break="no"/>amble. And it was either by art or acci-
        			<lb break="no"/>dent, that he told her, pretty justly, her 
        			<lb/>feelings—that she had propensities for un-
        			<lb break="no"/>common enterprizes, and pressed to know 
        			<lb/>why she had held them in suspension so 
        			<lb/>long.—Having predicated, that the success 
        			<lb/>of her adventures, if undertaken, would 
        			<lb/>more than compensate a few difficulties, 
        			<lb/>she left him with a mind more discomposed, 
        			<lb/>than when she found him. But before she 
        			<lb/>reached home she found her resolution 
        			<lb/>strengthened. She resolved soon to com-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>mence her ramble, and in the same clandes-
        			<lb break="no"/>tine plight, in which she had been to the ne-
        			<lb break="no"/>cromancer. She thought of bending her 
        			<lb/>first course to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, the metropolis 
        			<lb/>of <placeName>America</placeName>.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IN <date when="1781-03">March, 1781</date>, the season being too 
        			<lb/>rough to commence her excursion, she 
        			<lb/>proposed to equip herself at leisure: and 
        			<lb/>then appoint the time for her departure. 
        			<lb/>A handsome piece of cloth was to be put 
        			<lb/>to a use, of which she little thought, du-
        			<lb break="no"/>ring the time she was employed in man-
        			<lb break="no"/>ufacturing it.—Ye sprightly Fair, what is 
        			<lb/>there in your domestic department, that 
        			<lb/>necessity, ingenuity and resolution cannot 
        			<lb/>accomplish?—She made her a genteel 
        			<lb/>coat, waistcoat and breeches without any 
        			<lb/>other assistance, than the uncouth patterns 
        			<lb/>belonging to her former master’s family. 
        			<lb/>The other articles, hat, shoes, &amp;c. were 
        			<lb/>purchased under invented pretexts.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BEFORE she had accomplished her appa-
        			<lb break="no"/>ratus, her mind being intent, as the reader 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>must imagine, on the <emph style="font-style: italic">use</emph> to which they were 
        			<lb/>soon to be appropriated; an idea, no less 
        			<lb/>singular and surprising, than true and im-
        			<lb break="no"/>portant, determined her to relinquish her 
        			<lb/>plan of travelling for that of joining the 
        			<lb/>American Army in the character of a volun-
        			<lb break="no"/>tary soldier. This proposal concurred with 
        			<lb/>her inclinations on many accounts. Whilst 
        			<lb/>she should have equal opportunities for 
        			<lb/>surveying and contemplating the world, 
        			<lb/>she should be accumulating some lucrative 
        			<lb/>profit; and in the end, perhaps, be instru-
        			<lb break="no"/>mental in the CAUSE of LIBERTY, which had 
        			<lb/>for nearly six years enveloped the minds 
        			<lb/>of her countrymen.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HERE I might bring forward her former 
        			<lb/>monitors, and represent the affecting dia-
        			<lb break="no"/>logues, which no virtuous mind wishes to 
        			<lb/>dispute, she held with them on this try-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing occasion. But I leave this for the po-
        			<lb break="no"/>et, novelist, or some more able pen. Suf-
        			<lb break="no"/>fice it to say, the following motto is the 
        			<lb/>chief result of her debates:—“<term style="font-style: italic">There may 
        				<pb/>
        				<lb/>be an heroic <hi rend="roman">INNOCENCE</hi> as well as an heroic</term> 
        			<lb/>COURAGE.” <emph style="font-style: italic">Custom</emph>, not <emph style="font-style: italic">virtue</emph>, must lose its 
        			<lb/>name by transition; unless <emph style="font-style: italic">custom</emph> be made 
        			<lb/>the <emph style="font-style: italic">criterion</emph> of virtue. She debated, with 
        			<lb/>all the force of eloquence, that a sense of 
        			<lb/>duty to a parent or mistress could produce, 
        			<lb/>whether to communicate her intentions to 
        			<lb/>them, or to make a confident of any one 
        			<lb/>in so important an undertaking. She re-
        			<lb break="no"/>solved in the negative, for this reason:—
        			<lb/>If her pursuits should terminate in an event, 
        			<lb/>that should cause her to lament her en-
        			<lb break="no"/>gagement, she should not reflect upon her-
        			<lb break="no"/>self for having gone counter to their advice 
        			<lb/>and injunctions; though she might, for not 
        			<lb/>asking and adhering to them. In either 
        			<lb/>case, she meant to make an expiation.

        			<lb/>dignifies your character, and renders you 
        			<lb/>the amiable companions of man. Heaven, 
        			<lb/>who has aided <emph style="font-style: italic"><persName>Columbia’s</persName> Cause</emph>, recognise 
        			<lb/>my sincerity! And although it has been 
        		<lb/>purchased, mostly, at the dear expense of 
        		<lb/>her <emph style="font-style: italic">sons; you</emph> have not remained uninter-
        		<lb break="no"/>ested nor without the pang of the distressed

        			<lb/>example of our Heroine, should the like oc-
        			<lb break="no"/>casion again offer; yet, we must do her 
        			<lb/>justice. Whether that <emph style="font-style: italic">liberty</emph>, which has 
        			<lb/>now cemented us in so happy an un-

        			SEVERAL circumstances concurred, in 
        			<lb/>this interim, which could not have failed 
        			<lb/>to excite peculiar emotions. She knew her 
        			<lb/>mother had long doated on her future fe-
        			<lb break="no"/>licity, with a young gentleman of fortune, 
        			<lb/>and agreeable deportment; and with whom 
        			<lb/>she had contracted an intimate and endear-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing acquaintance. He had given her ma-
        			<lb break="no"/>ny cordial proofs of the sincerity of his at-
        			<lb break="no"/>tachment and lasting affections. And had 
        			<lb/>her mind been disincumbered with a high-
        			<lb break="no"/>ser object in view, she might, doubtless, 
        			<lb/>have united her affections in the happiest 
        			<lb/>alliance for life. Already did she consider 
        			<lb/>a parent not only disappointed in her warm-
        			<lb break="no"/>est wishes, but distracted with anguish by 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>the elopement, and for aught she knew, the 
        			<lb/>fatal and untimely catastrophe of a daugh-
        			<lb break="no"/>ter. She felt for those who had taken the 
        			<lb/>charge of her youth; whose affections had 
        			<lb/>not been alienated by her disobedience. 
        			<lb/>For him, who loved her, she felt with emo-
        			<lb break="no"/>tions, that had not before alarmed her. In-
        			<lb break="no"/>deed, such groups of ideas, that hurried 
        			<lb/>upon her mind, must have been too much 
        			<lb/>for a breast naturally tender. She retired 
        			<lb/>to indulge the effects of nature: And in 
        			<lb/>this seclusion, resolved, should her pursuit 
        			<lb/>succeed, to write to her mother in a man-
        			<lb break="no"/>ner, that might pacify her mind without 
        			<lb/>disclosing the delicate stratagem.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BUT neither the rigor of a parent to in-
        			<lb break="no"/>duce her marriage with one, whom she did 
        			<lb/>not dislike, nor her own abhorrence of the 
        			<lb/>idea of being considered a <emph style="font-style: italic">female candidate</emph> 
        			<lb/>for conjugal union, is the cause of her 
        			<lb/>turning volunteer in the American War; 
        			<lb/>as may hereafter, partly, be con-
        			<lb break="no"/>jectured by an anonymous writer. This 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>must be the greatest obstacle to the magic 
        			<lb/>charm of the novelist. She did not slight 
        		    <lb/>love; nor was she a distracted <seg xml:id="a062" corresp="#n062">inamorato.</seg><note xml:id="n062" corresp="#a062"><term style="font-style: italic">Inamorato</term>: lover (Italian, in the masculine form).</note> 
        			<lb/>She considered it a divine gift: nor was 
        			<lb/>she deceived. For, strike <emph style="font-style: italic">love</emph> out of the 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">soul</emph>, life becomes insipid and the whole 
        			<lb/>body falls into lethargy. Love being 
        			<lb/>always, attended by hope, wafts us a-
        			<lb break="no"/>greeably through life.—She was a <emph style="font-style: italic">lover;</emph> 
        			<lb/>but different from those, whose love is on-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly a short epilepsy, or for the gratification 
        			<lb/>of fantastical and criminal pleasure. This, 
        			<lb/>I trust, will be demonstrated by a fact, to 
        			<lb/>which, but few can appeal. Her love ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>tended to all. And I know not, but she 
        			<lb/>continues to have this consoling reflection, 
        			<lb/>that no one can tax her for having coveted 
        			<lb/>the prohibited enjoyment of any individ-
        			<lb break="no"/>ual. This is that love, whose original 
        			<lb/>source and motive induced <persName>Columbia’s</persName> sons 
        			<lb/>to venture their property, endearments—
        			<lb/>their lives! to gain themselves the posses-
        			<lb break="no"/>sion of that heaven-born companion, called 
        			<lb/><term style="font-style: italic">liberty:</term> and which, when applied to con-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>jugal union, is the same thing, only differ-
        			<lb break="no"/>ently combined with the other passions. 
        			<lb/>And whatever effect it may then have had 
        			<lb/>on her, she has since been heard to say, 
        			<lb/>without reserve—That she deemed it more 
        			<lb/>honorable for one to be <emph style="font-style: italic">suffocated</emph> with the 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">smoke</emph> of <emph style="font-style: italic">cannon</emph> in the <emph style="font-style: italic">Cause</emph>, in which she 
        				<lb/>was then embarked, than to waste a useful in-
        			<lb break="no"/>tended existence in despair, because Heav-
        			<lb break="no"/>en had justly denied the favorite of a whim-
        			<lb break="no"/>sical and capricious fancy. The <choice><sic>perseverence</sic><corr>perseve-
        				<lb break="no"/>rance</corr></choice> for the object, dictated by love, in 
        			<lb/>both cases, corroborates, beyond doubt, 
        			<lb/>its efficacy and utility. 
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			JUST before her departure, she received 
        			<lb/>a polite invitation to join a circle of her 
        			<lb/>acquaintance for rural festivity. She was 
        			<lb/>cheerful; and the rest of the company 
        			<lb/>more so. Among many lively topics, it was 
        			<lb/>remarked that <persName>Mr. ——</persName>, brother to a 
        			<lb/>lady not present, had been killed in the 
        			<lb/>battle at <placeName>Long-Island</placeName>, in <placeName>New York</placeName>. It 
        			<lb/>was brushed into oblivion by concluding—
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>his sweetheart was again courted. It drew 
        			<lb/>involuntary tears from our intended hero-
        			<lb break="no"/>ine, which were noticed. In the evening, 
        			<lb/>she returned home with emotions, that 
        			<lb/>might affect a lover.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			NEXT day, the weather was exceeding-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly pleasant; and nature smiled with the sea-
        			<lb break="no"/>son. <persName>Miss SAMPSON</persName> performed her busi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ness with much affected gaiety and spright-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly conversation: But the night was to be 
        			<lb/>big with the important event.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HAVING put in readiness the materials, 
        			<lb/>she had judged requisite, she retired, at 
        			<lb/>her usual hour, to bed, intending to rise at 
        			<lb/>twelve. She was, doubtless, punctual. 
        			<lb/>But there was none, but the INVISIBLE, 
        			<lb/>who could take cognizance of the effusions 
        			<lb/>of passion on assuming her new garb; but 
        			<lb/>especially, on reflecting upon the <emph style="font-style: italic">use</emph>, for 
        			<lb/>which it was assigned—on leaving her con-
        			<lb break="no"/>nections, and even the vicinity, where the 
        			<lb/>flower of her life had expanded, and was 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>then in its bloom. She took her course 
        			<lb/>towards <placeName>Taunton</placeName>, in hopes of meeting with 
        			<lb/>some stranger, who was going directly to 
        			<lb/>Head-Quarters, then at the Southward.—
        			<lb/>Having walked all night she was just enter-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing the Green in <placeName>Taunton</placeName>, when the bright 
        			<lb/>luminary of day, which had so often gleam-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed upon her in the rusticity of a shepherdess, 
        			<lb/>then found her, not, indeed, impressed on-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly with the simple care of a brood of chick-
        			<lb break="no"/>ens or a bleating lamb—but with a no less 
        			<lb/>important CAUSE, than that, in which the 
        			<lb/>future felicity of <placeName>America</placeName> was then sus-
        			<lb break="no"/>pended. The reflection startled her: but 
        		    <lb/>female <seg xml:id="a063" corresp="#n063">temerities</seg><note xml:id="n063" corresp="#a063"><term style="font-style: italic">Temerities</term>: acts of recklessness.</note> were not to be palliated.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			AT this instant, she unwelcomely met 
        			<lb/><persName>Mr. WILLIAM BENNETT</persName>, her near neigh-
        		    <lb break="no"/>bor. Surely, an <seg xml:id="a064" corresp="#n064">apoplexy</seg><note xml:id="n064" corresp="#a064"><term style="font-style: italic">Apoplexy</term>: a sudden illness or paralytic fit.</note> could not have 
        			<lb/>given her a more sudden shock. Though 
        			<lb/>she was not positive he had discovered her 
        			<lb/>masquerade; yet, she knew if he had, she 
        			<lb/>should be pursued when he reached home.
        			<lb/>—After some refreshment, and supplying 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>her pockets with a few biscuit, she hastened 
        			<lb/>through the town; but determined not to 
        			<lb/>bend her course directly for the Army, till 
        			<lb/>she should know what had been done about 
        			<lb/>her clandestine elopement. Fatigued with 
        			<lb/>walking, she took an obscure path, that 
        			<lb/>led half a mile into a thicket of wood; 
        			<lb/>where the boughs of a large pine served for 
        			<lb/>her canopy during her repose till evening. 
        			<lb/>Surprised when she awoke on finding it 
        			<lb/>dark, with difficulty, she regained the road; 
        			<lb/>and by the next peep of dawn, found her-
        			<lb break="no"/>self in the environs of her former neigh-
        			<lb break="no"/>borhood.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			DEJECTED at the sight of the place, 
        			<lb/>where she had enjoyed so much rural feli-
        			<lb break="no"/>city, she half resolved to relinquish all 
        			<lb/>thoughts of further enterprize, and to palli-
        			<lb break="no"/>ate what had passed, as a foible, from which 
        			<lb/>females are not always exempt. The de-
        			<lb break="no"/>bate was not long. As usual, she must per-
        			<lb break="no"/>severe, and make the best of what might 
        			<lb/>prove a bad choice. The groves were her 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>sanctuary for meditation that day and the 
        			<lb/>succeeding night. After the birds had 
        			<lb/>sung their evening carols, she lay down 
        			<lb/>with intentions to sleep: but necessity, our 
        			<lb/>old alarming friend, roused her attention. 
        			<lb/>Impelled by hunger, during the tranquillity 
        			<lb/>of the village, she repaired to a house she 
        			<lb/>had much frequented, with intentions to 
        			<lb/>appease the cravings of nature. Going to 
        			<lb/>a pantry, where victuals was wont to be 
        			<lb/>deposited, and meeting with no better suc-
        			<lb break="no"/>cess than a crust of bread, she again retired 
        			<lb/>to her solitary asylum.—The caroling of 
        			<lb/>the feathered tribe having again notified 
        			<lb/>her of day, she resumed her ramble, and 
        			<lb/>soon lost sight of those

        			HEARING nothing concerning her elope-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment, she concluded to take a circui-

        			<lb/>towns, and visit <placeName>Boston</placeName>, the capital of <placeName>Mas-

        			<lb/>From thence, she visited some of the Wes-
        			<lb break="no"/>tern towns in the State. Finding herself 
        			<lb/>among strangers, her fear of being discov-

        			<lb/>which is to continue, perhaps, for life, to 
        			<lb/>accomplish some important event. She 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>acted her part: and having a natural taste 
        			<lb/>for refinement, she was everywhere receiv-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed as a blithe, handsome and agreeable 
        			<lb/>young gentleman.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IT may be conjectured, whether or not, 
        			<lb/>she meant to see the army before she en-
        			<lb break="no"/>listed. By what follows, it appears she did 
        			<lb/>not. She doubtless chose to engage for 
        			<lb/><placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>; not because she could ren-
        			<lb break="no"/>der any more service, but because it is 
        			<lb/>her native State, and which had been the 
        			<lb/>opening of the first scene of the horrid <emph style="font-style: italic">dra-
        				<lb break="no"/>ma</emph>, and had suffered most by its actors.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IN <placeName>Bellingham</placeName> she met with a specula-

        			<lb/>the preceding winter in the city of <placeName>Phila-

        			<lb/>sought for revenge. He conspired with 
        			<lb/><persName>Sir HENRY CLINTON</persName> to deliver <placeName>West-

        			IN the morning, she crossed the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, 
        			<lb/>near <placeName>Fort Clinton</placeName>. This is one of the most

        			<lb/>source is between the <placeName>lakes Ontario</placeName>, and

        			THEY marched on level land, and quick-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly had orders to parade for inspection.—
        			<lb/>The soldiers were detached into their prop-

        		    The second day, she drew a French <seg xml:id="a073" corresp="#n073"><choice><sic>fusee</sic><corr>fuse</corr></choice>,</seg><note xml:id="n073" corresp="#a073"><term style="font-style: italic">Fusee</term>: a light musket; a <term style="font-style: italic">hanger</term> (below) is a short sword hung from a belt.</note> 
        			<lb/>a knapsack, cartridge-box, and thirty 
        			<lb/>cartridges. Her next business was to clean 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>her piece, and to exercise once every morn-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing in the drill, and at four o’clock, <emph style="font-style: italic">P. M.</emph> 
        			<lb/>on the grand parade. Her garb was ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>changed for a uniform peculiar to the in-
        			<lb break="no"/>fantry. It consisted of a blue coat lined 
        			<lb/>with white, with white wings on the shoul-
        			<lb break="no"/>ders and cords on the arms and pockets; 
        			<lb/>a white waistcoat, breeches or overhauls 
        			<lb/>and stockings, with black straps about the 
        			<lb/>knees; half boots a black velvet stock, 
        			<lb/>and a cap, with a variegated cockade, on 
        			<lb/>one side, a plume tipped with red on the 
        			<lb/>other, and a white sash about the crown. 
        			<lb/>Her martial apparatus, exclusive of those 
        			<lb/>in marches, were a gun and bayonet, a car-
        			<lb break="no"/>tridge-box and hanger with white belts. 
        			<lb/>She says, she learned the manual exercise 
        			<lb/>with facility and dispatch, though she lost 
        			<lb/>her appetite; which, through favor, she af-
        			<lb break="no"/>terwards recovered.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HER stature is perhaps more than the 
        			<lb/>middle size; that is, five feet and seven in-
        			<lb break="no"/>ches. The features of her face are regu-
        			<pb/>
        		    <lb break="no"/>lar; but not what a <seg xml:id="a074" corresp="#n074">physiognomist</seg><note xml:id="n074" corresp="#a074"><term style="font-style: italic">Physiognomist</term>: a person who reads faces or other physical features to discern character.</note> would 
        			<lb/>term the most beautiful. Her eye is live-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly and penetrating. She has a skin natur-
        			<lb break="no"/>ally clear, and flushed with a blooming car-
        			<lb break="no"/>nation. But her aspect is rather masculine 
        			<lb/>and serene, than effeminate and sillily jo-
        			<lb break="no"/>cose. Her waist might displease a co-
        			<lb break="no"/>quette: but her limbs are regularly pro-
        			<lb break="no"/>portioned. Ladies of taste considered 
        			<lb/>them handsome, when in the masculine

        			SUCH is the natural formation, and such

        			<lb/>dreadful I hope, to most men, and certain-

        			<lb/>the commencement of such an enterprise a 
        			<lb/>great presumption in a <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph>, on account of 
        			<lb/>the inadequateness of her nature. Love 
        			<lb/>and propensity are nearly allied; and we 
        			<lb/>have, already, discovered the efficacy of 
        			<lb/>both. No love is without hope: but that 
        			<lb/>only is genuine, which has, for its object 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">virtue</emph>, and is attended with resolution and 
        			<lb/>magnanimity. By these, the animal econ-
        			<lb break="no"/>omy is enabled to surmount difficulties and 
        			<lb/>to accomplish enterprises and attain ob-
        			<lb break="no"/>jects, which are unattainable by the efforts 
        			<lb/>of the other passions. When love sinks into 
        			<lb/>despondency, the whole system becomes 
        			<lb/>enervated, and is rendered incapacitated 
        			<lb/>for the attainment of common objects.—
        			<lb/>What is <term style="font­-style: italic">Liberty</term>—I mean, in a genuine 
        			<lb/>sense? The love of it prompts to the ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>posure of our property and the jeopardy 
        			<lb/>of our lives. This is the surest definition 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>of it: For interwoven with and dependent on 
        			<lb/>it, are all our enjoyments. Consequently,

        			WE have already found, that she did 
        			<lb/>not engage in this perhaps unprecedented 
        			<lb/>achievement, without the precaution of re-
        			<lb break="no"/>flection and pathetic debates on the cause. 
        			<lb/>And this renders her more excusable than

        			<lb/>the battle, before they establish their prop-
        			<lb break="no"/>er <emph style="font-style: italic">ultimatum</emph>, which is derived only from a

        			<lb/>effect of a confederated Republic, than of 
        			<lb/>the jurisdiction of an unlimited monarch. 
        			<lb/>But neither a delirium, nor love in distrac-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion, has driven her precipitate to this dire-
        			<lb break="no"/>ful extremity. In cool blood, yet with 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>firm attachment, we now see blended in 
        			<lb/>her, the peerlessness of enterprise, the de-

        			ON the tenth day in the morning, at re-

        			<lb break="no"/>longed, with some others, had orders to pa-

        			<lb/>provision; which, with her large sack of

        			<lb/>been a burden too much for females, ac-

        		<p>
        		    ON <date when="1781-07-03">July 3d</date>, she experienced in a great-
        			<lb break="no"/>er degree, what she had before mostly 
        			<lb/>known by anticipation. <persName>Captain WEBB’s</persName> 
        			<lb/>company being on a scout in the morning, 
        			<lb/>and headed by <persName>Ensign TOWN</persName>, came up

        			<lb/>were armed with carabines, or fusees, and

        			<lb/>their side. The Americans withstood two 
        			<lb/>fires before they had orders to retaliate. 
        			<lb/>The ground was then warmly disputed for 
        			<lb/>considerable time. At length, the infan-
        			<lb break="no"/>try were obliged to give way: but they 
        			<lb/>were quickly reinforced by a detachment 
        			<lb/>led on by <persName>Col. SPROAT</persName>, a valiant officer 
        			<lb/>of the second <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> regiment. 
        			<lb/>They were then too much for the enemy, 
        			<lb/>although a large number had landed from 
        			<lb/>boats for their assistance. The ground they 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>had gained was then measured back with 
        			<lb/>precipitance, even to a considerable dis-
        			<lb break="no"/>tance within their own lines, where the 
        			<lb/>action terminated.

        			THE Americans having retired to their

        			<lb/>others, came near losing her life by drink-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing cold water. She says, she underwent 
        			<lb/>more with the fatigue and heat of the day, 
        			<lb/>than by fear of being killed; although 
        			<lb/>her left-hand man was shot dead at the second 
        			<lb/>fire, and her ears and eyes were continual-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly tormented with the expiring agonies and 
        			<lb/>horrid scenes of many others struggling 
        			<lb/>in their blood. She recollects but three 
        			<lb/>on her side who were killed, <persName>JOHN BEEBY</persName>, 
        			<lb/><persName>JAMES BATTLES</persName> and <persName>NOOBLE SPERIN</persName>. 
        			<lb/>She escaped with two shots through her 
        			<lb/>coat, and one through her cap.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			PERHAPS, by this time, some may be 
        		    <lb/>ready to tax her with extreme <seg xml:id="a079" corresp="#n079">obduracy,</seg><note xml:id="n079" corresp="#a079"><term style="font-style: italic">Obduracy</term>: stubbornness.</note> 
        			<lb/>and, without mercy, to announce her void 
        			<lb/>of all delicacy of sentiment and feeling. 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>And really, had this been her customary 
        			<lb/>plight in her kitchen at home, she might 
        			<lb/>not have passed for an agreeable compan-
        			<lb break="no"/>ion: for she was perfectly besmeared with 
        			<lb/>gunpowder. But if we reflect, that this 
        			<lb/>was not the effect of indolence or sluttish-
        		    <lb break="no"/>ness, but for <choice><sic>ought</sic><corr>aught</corr></choice> we know, of the most 
        			<lb/>endearing attachment to her country; it 
        			<lb/>ought, at least, to awaken the gratitude of 
        			<lb/>those, who may remain too callous to this 
        			<lb/>great philanthropic passion. It behooves 
        			<lb/>every one to consider, that war, though to 
        			<lb/>the highest degree destructive and horrid, 
        			<lb/>is effectually calculated to rouze up many 
        			<lb/>tender and sympathetic passions. If the 
        			<lb/>principles of humanity and benevolence 
        			<lb/>are ever to be <emph style="font-style: italic">forced</emph> into exertion, war, 
        			<lb/>which should be the last resource, must h
        			<lb/>ave the desired effect. And this renders 
        			<lb/>it, at best, but a necessary evil; and the 
        			<lb/>promoters of it are the subjects of the great-
        			<lb break="no"/>est aspersion. Let us be free from all oth-
        			<lb break="no"/>er evils, to which dire necessity does not 
        			<lb/>prompt, and we may excuse, even a <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph>, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>for taking arms in defence of all that is 
        			<lb/>dear and lovely.—She, doubtless, once 
        			<lb/>thought she could never look on the <emph style="font-style: italic">battle
        				<lb/>-array</emph>. She now says no pen can describe 
        			<lb/>her feelings experienced in the commence-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment of an engagement, the sole object of 
        			<lb/>which is, to open the sluices of human 
        			<lb/>blood. The unfeigned tear of humanity 
        			<lb/>has more than once started into her eye in 
        			<lb/>the rehearsal of such a scene as I have just 
        			<lb/>described.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			FROM this time till Autumn, nothing un-
        			<lb break="no"/>usual in war happened to her. Indeed, it 
        			<lb/>may be said, everything she did in this sit-
        			<lb break="no"/>uation was <emph style="font-style: italic">singular</emph>; much of which might 
        			<lb/>afford amusement and moral inferences. 
        			<lb/>But the limits prescribed to these MEMOIRS 
        			<lb/>will not admit the detail of minute circum-
        			<lb break="no"/>stances.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IN August, the <persName>Marquis DE LA FAY-
        				<lb break="no"/>ETTE</persName> had been dispatched from the main 
        			<lb/>army to contemplate the operations of <persName>Lord 
        				<pb/>
        				<lb/>CORNWALLIS’s</persName> army in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>. After a 
        			<lb/>multiplicity of military manœuvres be-
        			<lb break="no"/>tween them, his Lordship selected <placeName>York-
        				<lb/>Town</placeName> and <placeName>Gloucester Point</placeName> as the most con-
        			<lb break="no"/>spicuous and advantageous posts for the 
        			<lb/>seat of military operations.—<placeName>York-Town</placeName> 
        			<lb/>lies on the river of the same name, which 
        			<lb/>empties into the <placeName>Chesapeak</placeName>. It forms a 
        			<lb/>capacious harbor, admitting ships of great 
        			<lb/>burthen. <placeName>Gloucester Point</placeName> being on the 
        			<lb/>opposite side, and projecting so far into the 
        			<lb/>river, that the distance being but about a mile, 
        			<lb/>they entirely command the navigation of 
        			<lb/>it. Thither <persName>CORNWALLIS</persName> with 7000 ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>cellent troops repaired; strongly fortified 
        			<lb/>the places, and made other good arrange-
        			<lb break="no"/>ments.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ABOUT the last of August <persName>Count DE 
        				<lb/>GRASSE</persName> arrived with a powerful French 
        			<lb/>fleet in the <placeName>Chesapeak</placeName>, and blockaded 
        			<lb/><placeName>York-Town</placeName>by water. Soon after, <persName>Admi-
        				<lb break="no"/>ral GRAVES</persName> with a fleet appeared off the 
        			<lb/>capes of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>. The French immedi-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>ately slipped their cables, turned out of 
        			<lb/>their anchorage ground, and an action suc-
        			<lb break="no"/>ceeded; and though both sides sustained 
        			<lb/>considerable loss, it was not decisive.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			The Generals, <persName>WASHINGTON</persName> and <persName>RO-
        				<lb break="no"/>CHAMBEAU</persName> had previously moved their 
        			<lb/>main armies to the Southward: and when 
        			<lb/>they heard of the French Admiral’s arrival 
        			<lb/>in the <placeName>Chesapeak</placeName>, they made the most rapid 
        			<lb/>marches till they arrived at the head of 
        			<lb/>the Elk. Within an hour after their arri-
        			<lb break="no"/>val, they received an express from <persName>DE 
        				<lb/>GRASSE</persName>, with the joyful intelligence of his 
        			<lb/>arrival and situation. The combined ar-
        			<lb break="no"/>mies embarked on board the vessels which 
        			<lb/>the French Admiral had previously prepa-
        			<lb break="no"/>red to transport them down the <placeName>Chesapeak</placeName>; 
        			<lb/>and by the 25th of September they landed 
        			<lb/>at <placeName>Williamsburgh</placeName>. The American and 
        			<lb/>French Chief Commanders had reached 
        			<lb/><placeName>Williamsburgh</placeName> by excessive travelling ele-
        			<lb break="no"/>ven days sooner. They immediately pro-
        			<lb break="no"/>ceeded to visit the Admiral on board the 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>Villa de Paris. A council being called, 
        			<lb/>and their plan of co-operations settled, they 
        			<lb/>returned; and all the Americans and al-
        			<lb break="no"/>lied troops soon formed a collision at <placeName>Wil-
        				<lb break="no"/>liamsburgh</placeName>. <persName>FAYETTE</persName> had previously 
        			<lb/>been joined by 3000 under the <persName>Marquis 
        				<lb/>DE ST. SIMON</persName>: The whole regular force 
        			<lb/>thus collected, amounted to nearly 12,000 
        			<lb/>men, exclusive of the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> militia, 
        			<lb/>which were called to service, and com-
        			<lb break="no"/>manded by <persName>v</persName>. Preparations 
        			<lb/>were then made with great dispatch for 
        			<lb/>putting the army in a situation to move on 
        			<lb/>to <placeName>York-Town</placeName>.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IT is almost needless to mention the 
        			<lb/>hardships, that common soldiers must have 
        			<lb/>undergone in so long and rapid a march. 
        			<lb/>The deficiency of clothing, particularly of 
        			<lb/>shoes, but most of all, the scanty and 
        			<lb/>wretched quality of provisions, aug-
        			<lb break="no"/>mented their sufferings. Our heroine sus-
        			<lb break="no"/>tained her march from some part of <placeName>New-
        				<lb/>York</placeName> with good heart, and without faltering, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>till the day on which she landed with the 
        			<lb/>troops at <placeName>Williamsburgh</placeName>. She was then 
        			<lb/>much indisposed; which was not the only 
        			<lb/>time she had experienced the inconvenien-
        			<lb break="no"/>ces of the concealment of her sex. She 
        			<lb/>puked for several hours without much in-
        			<lb break="no"/>termission; which she imputed chiefly to 
        			<lb/>the rolling of the vessel. With the rest, 
        			<lb/>she here drew good provision and spirits: 
        			<lb/>and by the next day, she was revived; and 
        			<lb/>the lustre and august manœuvring of the 
        			<lb/>army seemed to perfect a cure beyond the 
        			<lb/>reach of medicine.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ON the morning of the <date when="1781-09-28">28th of Septem-
        				<lb break="no"/>ber</date>, after parade and review, general orders 
        			<lb/>were read to the armies; wherein his Excel-
        			<lb break="no"/>lency, <persName>Gen. WASHINGTON</persName>, emphatically 
        			<lb/>enjoined—“If the enemy should be tempt-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed to meet the army on its march, the <persName>Gen-
        				<lb break="no"/>eral</persName> particularly enjoins the troops to place 
        			<lb/>their principal reliance on the <emph style="font-style: italic">bayonet</emph>, 
        			<lb/>that they may prove the <emph style="font-style: italic">vanity of the boast, 
        				<pb/>
        				<lb/>which the British make of their peculiar prow-
        				<lb break="no"/>ess in deciding battles by that weapon</emph>.” After 
        			<lb/>this, the American and French Chief Com-
        			<lb break="no"/>manders personally addressed their ar-
        			<lb break="no"/>mies. Our blooming <emph style="font-style: italic">soldier</emph>, always atten-
        			<lb break="no"/>tive to understand every new manœuvre 
        			<lb/>and eventful scene, happened to stand so 
        			<lb/>near his Excellency <persName>Gen. WASHINGTON</persName>, 
        			<lb/>that she heard distinctly what he said. He 
        			<lb/>spoke with firm articulation and winning 
        			<lb/>gestures: but his aspect and solemn mode 
        			<lb/>of utterance affectingly bespoke the great 
        			<lb/>weight, that rested on his mind. The com-
        			<lb break="no"/>mon soldiers were before mostly ignorant 
        			<lb/>of the expedition, upon which they were 
        			<lb/>going. Being now informed by general or-
        			<lb break="no"/>ders and the affectionate addresses of their 
        			<lb/>leaders, every countenance, even of many 
        			<lb/>who had discovered a mutinizing spirit, 
        			<lb/>wore an agreeable aspect, and a mutual har-
        			<lb break="no"/>mony and reverential acquiescence in the 
        			<lb/>injunctions of their commanders were re-
        			<lb break="no"/>ciprocated through the whole.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        		    THE <seg xml:id="a080" corresp="#n080">phalanx</seg><note xml:id="n080" corresp="#a080"><term style="font-style: italic">Phalanx</term>: a battle-line in tight formation.</note> composed the advanced 
        			<lb/>guards, and was mostly commanded by <persName>DE LA 
        				<lb/>FAYETTE</persName>. Our Heroine was one of these; 
        			<lb/>and by reason of the absence of a non-
        			<lb/>commissioned officer, she was appointed to 
        			<lb/>supply his place. Just before the setting 
        			<lb/>of the sun, <persName>Col. SCAMMELL</persName>, being officer 
        			<lb/>of the day, brought word for the army to 
        			<lb/>halt two miles from <placeName>York-Town</placeName>. The of-
        			<lb break="no"/>ficers and soldiers were strictly enjoined to 
        			<lb/>lie on their arms all night.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			SUCH language (strange to say) was per-
        			<lb break="no"/>fectly familiar to our fair soldier. It did 
        			<lb/>not even excite in her a tremor: although 
        			<lb/>it was a prelude to imminent danger. She 
        			<lb/>had been used to keep her martial appara-
        			<lb break="no"/>tus bright and in the best order; as they 
        			<lb/>were often prematurely wanted. Antici-
        			<lb break="no"/>pating no greater danger than she had often 
        			<lb/>actually experienced, although she forebod-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed a great event, she acquiesced in the 
        			<lb/>mandates of her officers with a calmness, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>that might have surprised an unexperien-
        			<lb break="no"/>ced soldier.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			NEXT morning, after roll-call, their e-
        			<lb break="no"/>quipments again reviewed, they went 
        			<lb/>through the quick motions of loading and 
        			<lb/>firing blank cartridges by the motion of 
        			<lb/>the sword. They formed in close column, 
        			<lb/>displayed to the right and left, and formed 
        			<lb/>again. The grand division then displayed, 
        			<lb/>formed by platoon, when they were order-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed to march in the best order. The next 
        			<lb/>day, <persName>Col. SCAMMELL</persName>, approaching the ene-
        			<lb break="no"/>my’s works, was mortally wounded and 
        			<lb/>taken prisoner by a party of horse in am-
        			<lb break="no"/>buscade. <placeName>York-Town</placeName> was this day strong-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly invested by the allied armies. Their 
        			<lb/>lines being formed, the French extending 
        			<lb/>from the river above the town to a morass, 
        			<lb/>where they were met by the Americans on 
        			<lb/>the right, their hard fatigues begun. They 
        			<lb/>continued more than a week laborious, 
        			<lb/>sustaining a very heavy cannonade from 
        			<lb/>the besieged. This business came near 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>proving too much for a <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph> in her teens. 
        			<lb/>Being naturally ambitious, it was mortifi-
        			<lb break="no"/>cation too severe for her to be outdone. 
        			<lb/>Many apparently able-bodied men com-
        			<lb break="no"/>plained they were unfit for duty, and 
        			<lb/>were relieved. Among others, she affect-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed pleasure in giving them the mortifying 
        			<lb/>consolation—that, although she believed 
        			<lb/>their <emph style="font-style: italic">fever</emph> was settled upon them, she hoped 
        			<lb/>it would prove nothing worse than the 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">cannon</emph> or <emph style="font-style: italic">gun-powder fever</emph>.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE fifth night, she was one of a party, 
        			<lb/>who was ordered to work on a battery; 
        			<lb/>the completion of which had been pre-
        			<lb break="no"/>vented by a too intense rain of bombs. Be-
        			<lb break="no"/>fore morning, she was almost ready to yield 
        			<lb/>to the horrors of despair. Her hands 
        			<lb/>were so blistered, that she could scarcely 
        			<lb/>open or shut them: and it was nearly 
        			<lb/>twenty four hours since she had taken 
        			<lb/>much nourishment. But she resolved to 
        			<lb/>persevere as long as nature would make her 
        			<lb/>efforts; which she effected almost beyond 
        			<lb/>credibility.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			ON the ninth, the American intrench-
        			<lb break="no"/>ments being completed, a severe cannon-
        			<lb break="no"/>ade and bombardment commenced by 
        			<lb/>them on the right, and continued all night 
        			<lb/>without intermission. Next morning, the 
        			<lb/>French opened their redoubts and batte-
        			<lb break="no"/>ries on the left; and a tremendous roar of 
        			<lb/>cannon and mortars continued that day 
        			<lb/>without ceasing.—Our Heroine had nev-
        			<lb break="no"/>er before seen either of the main armies 
        			<lb/>together. Being thus brought into view 
        			<lb/>of them, and led on to a general engage-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment, doubtless excited in her sensations 
        			<lb/>and emotions different from what she had 
        			<lb/>before experienced. And I should need 
        		    <lb/>the pathos of a <seg xml:id="a081" corresp="#n081"><persName>HOMER</persName>, and the polished 
        		        <lb/>numbers of a <persName>HUME</persName> or <persName>POPE</persName>,</seg><note xml:id="n081" corresp="#a081"><term style="font-style: italic"><persName>Homer</persName></term>, c. 8C BCE Greek epic poet and author of the <bibl style="font­-style: italic">Iliad</bibl> and the <bibl style="font­-style: italic">Odyssey</bibl>; <persName>David <term style="font-style: italic">Hume</term></persName> (<date when="1711">1711</date>-<date when="1776">76</date>), the Scottish philosopher and historian, who, like the English poet and translator <persName>Alexander <term style="font-style: italic">Pope</term></persName> (<date when="1688">1688</date>-<date when="1744">1744</date>), was praised by many critics for clarity of style.</note> to do justice 
        			<lb/>to her feelings, or to exceed the reality of 
        			<lb/>this scenery.—The ground actually trem-
        			<lb break="no"/>bled for miles by the tremendous cannon-
        			<lb break="no"/>ade, which was incessantly maintained by 
        			<lb/>both sides day and night. Notwithstand-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing it was not so horribly destructive as is 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>generally the consequence of an open field 
        			<lb/>action; yet the contemplation of two im-
        			<lb break="no"/>mense armies, headed by the most illustri-
        			<lb break="no"/>ous leaders, each strenuously contending 
        			<lb/>for victory, must have afforded ideas pe-
        			<lb break="no"/>culiarly shocking and august. The nights 
        			<lb/>exhibited scenes, to the highest degree, sol-
        			<lb break="no"/>emn and awfully sublime. Perpetual sheets 
        			<lb/>of fire and smoke belched, as from a volca-
        			<lb break="no"/>no, and towered to the clouds. And whilst

        			<lb break="no"/>duce them by storm. To inspire emula-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion in the troops, the reduction of one 
        			<lb/>was committed to the Americans, and the 
        			<lb/>other to the French. A select corps was 
        			<lb/>chosen. The command of the infantry was 
        			<lb/>given to <persName>FAYETTE</persName>, with permission to man-
        			<lb break="no"/>age as he pleased. He therefore ordered

        			<lb break="no"/>ly, by putting them to the sword, after ha-
        			<lb break="no"/>ving carried the redoubts. Our Heroine 
        			<lb/>was one of these! At dark, they marched 
        			<lb/>to the assault with unloaded arms, but with 
        			<lb/>fixed bayonets; and with unexampled 
        			<lb/>bravery, attacking on all sides at once, 
        			<lb/>after some time of violent resistance, were 
        			<lb/>complete victors of the redoubts. There 
        			<lb/>were two women in the one attacked by 
        			<lb/>the Americans, and when our fair soldier 
        			<lb/>entered, the <emph style="font-style: italic">third</emph> was unknown. After 
        			<lb/>entering, the carnage was shocking for a 
        			<lb/>few minutes. She, standing near one of 
        		    <lb/>the women, heard her pronounce <seg xml:id="a083" corresp="#n083"><term style="font-style: italic">yan-

        			<lb/>utterance! After this, they cried and beg-
        			<lb break="no"/>ged so on their knees for quarters, that the 
        			<lb/>humanity of the Americans overcame all 
        			<lb/>resentment, and they spared all, who ceas-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed to resist; for which they were after-
        			<lb break="no"/>wards applauded by their humane officers. 
        			<lb/>Before they left the fort, one clapped her 
        			<lb/>on the shoulder, and said—“<emph style="font-style: italic">Friend, fear

        			<lb break="no"/>py for her, she found it no worse! The la-

        			THE French commanders, whose servi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ces demand the gratitude of every Amer-
        			<lb break="no"/>ican, led on their troops with a heroic bra-
        			<lb break="no"/>very, scarcely to be excelled. And whilst 
        			<lb/><persName>DE GRASSE</persName> displayed much valor, and was 
        			<lb/>doing great execution with his Armada, the 
        			<lb/>Americans, headed by the ever dear and 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>unrivalled <persName>WASHINGTON</persName>, redoubled their 
        			<lb/>activity and resolution. Nothing, thus, 
        			<lb/>but inevitable ruin, or an entire surrender, 
        			<lb/>awaited <persName>CORNWALLIS</persName>: And on the <date when="1781-10-19">19th 
        				<lb/>of October</date>, after three weeks severe storm, 
        			<lb/>an armistice having taken place for twenty-
        			<lb/>four hours, he was glad to accept the terms 
        			<lb/>of capitulation.—He was not permitted to 
        			<lb/>march out with colours flying—an honor 
        			<lb/>that had been refused to <persName>Gen. LINCOLN</persName> 
        			<lb/>the preceding winter, when he, with all 
        			<lb/>the American garrison, was captured in 
        			<lb/><placeName>Charleston, South Carolina</placeName>. <persName>Lincoln</persName> was 
        			<lb/>now appointed to receive his sword and the

        		<p>
        			THE marching out of such an immense 
        			<lb/>army, as prisoners of war, must have been 
        			<lb/>a scene the most solemn and important. 
        			<lb/>The magnanimity which was discovered in 
        			<lb/><persName>Gen. WASHINGTON</persName> upon this occasion, was 
        			<lb/>inexpressibly peculiar. Tears trickled from 
        			<lb/>his eyes during the most of the scene. 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>And a view of him in these moments must 
        			<lb/>have forced a tear of reverential grati-
        			<lb break="no"/>tude from the most obdurate. He thought 
        			<lb/>of his COUNTRY!—Remember the PATRI-

        			I SHALL leave our fair Soldier, or as she 
        			<lb/>was frequently called, the <term style="font­-style: italic">blooming boy</term>, in 
        			<lb/>winter quarters not far from <placeName>West-Point</placeName> 
        			<lb/>and the banks of the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, or <placeName>North 
        				<lb/>River</placeName>, in what were called the <placeName>York huts</placeName>. 
        			<lb/>She arrived at this place in <date when="1781-12">December</date>, 
        			<lb/>much debilitated and dispirited by hard 
        			<lb/>marches and fatigues. She was destitute 
        			<lb/>of shoes, as were most of the soldiers during 
        			<lb/>the march; excepting raw hides, which 
        			<lb/>they cut into straps and fastened about their 
        			<lb/>feet. It was not uncommon to track them 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>by the bleeding of their feet on the snow 
        			<lb/>and ice. And it appeared, their officers 
        			<lb/>fared not much better; although they used 
        			<lb/>their greatest efforts to soothe, animate and 
        			<lb/>encourage the soldiers, principally with the 
        			<lb/>prospects of peace, and the great honor 
        			<lb/>they should gain by persevering to the end.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			JUST before their arrival, one of her 
        			<lb/>company having been severely chastised 
        			<lb/>for stealing poultry, importuned her to de-
        			<lb break="no"/>sert with him and two others. But she not 
        			<lb/>only disdainfully refused, but used all the 
        			<lb/>eloquence, of which she was mistress, to 
        			<lb/>dissuade them from so presumptive an at-
        			<lb break="no"/>tempt. Having hazarded one desperate 
        			<lb/>presumption herself, she chose to take her 
        			<lb/>lot in the present and future ills; though, 
        			<lb/>peradventure, her sex might in some mea-
        			<lb break="no"/>sure, have justified her breach of contract. 
        			<lb/>The arguments she enforced were—that, 
        			<lb/>it would not only be an evidence of disloy-
        			<lb break="no"/>alty to their country, a token of cowardice, 
        			<lb/>a breech of civil obligation, but the greatest 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>jeopardy of their lives. As female eloquence 
        			<lb/>is generally irresistible, they here yielded 
        			<lb/>to its energy: although they were insensi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ble, that it was articulated through <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph> 
        			<lb/>organs.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HAVING repaired the huts, in which bu-
        			<lb break="no"/>siness she froze her feet to that degree that 
        			<lb/>she lost all her toe-nails, the soldiers were 
        			<lb/>culled, in order that all who had not had the 
        			<lb/>small-pox might be inoculated. The sol-
        			<lb break="no"/>diers, who were to be inoculated, paraded; 
        			<lb/>when our Heroine, for the first time, shewed 
        			<lb/>an aversion to it. Determined to hazard 
        			<lb/>taking this malignant distemper unaware, 
        			<lb/>she would even have falsified the truth of 
        			<lb/>her having had it, sooner than have gone to 
        			<lb/>the hospital; where the pride and glory 
        			<lb/>of her sex, the source of the <emph style="font-style: italic">blooming boy</emph>, 
        			<lb/>might have been disclosed.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			SHE did duty, sometimes as a common 
        			<lb/>soldier, and sometimes as a serjeant; which 
        			<lb/>was mostly on the lines, patrolling, collect-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>ing fuel, &amp;c. As the winter was very in-
        			<lb break="no"/>tense, the snow the most of the time deep, 
        			<lb/>I shall leave it for the considerate to ima-
        			<lb break="no"/>gine the unusual hardships of a female in 
        			<lb/>this situation. She went cheerful to her 
        			<lb/>tasks, and was never found loitering when 
        			<lb/>sent on duty or enterprize.

        			THE reader has long enough been in 
        			<lb/>suspense to know what effect her elope-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment had on her mother and connections, 
        			<lb/>and what method she took to pacify, as we 
        			<lb/>may suppose, their half distracted minds. 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>Though she received her education in ob-
        			<lb break="no"/>scurity, the news of her elopement, or a-
        			<lb break="no"/>mong other conjectures, that she had come 
        			<lb/>to some untimely catastrophe, flew to a great 
        			<lb/>distance. Her mother, raising a thousand 
        			<lb/>doubts and fears was almost inconsolably 
        			<lb/>wretched. Sometimes she harbored the 
        			<lb/>too often poignant reflection, that her too 
        			<lb/>rigorous exertions to precipitate her union 
        			<lb/>with the gentleman I have before mention-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed, had driven her to some direful and fatal 
        			<lb/>alternative. The like dire, alternate 
        			<lb/>thoughts filled her undissembled Lover, 
        			<lb/>with emotions he could ill conceal. And 
        			<lb/>like a man of sense and breeding, he com-
        			<lb break="no"/>miserated each of their misfortunes. Fran-
        			<lb break="no"/>tic at times, when reflection had pictured 
        			<lb/>to his imagination all her frightful groups of 
        			<lb/>ideas and images, he would curse his too 
        			<lb/>overbearing importunity and too open de-
        			<lb break="no"/>claration of his passions. These, he too late 
        			<lb/>surmised, were the cause of her leaving him 
        			<lb/>abruptly, (which, by the bye, is the reverse 
        			<lb/>of common circumstances) and, for aught 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>he knew, of her casual exit from all earthly 
        			<lb/>objects; or, that the too warm pressure of 
        			<lb/>his love had rendered him odious, and that 
        			<lb/>she had too justly punished him by throw-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing herself into the embraces of a more a-
        			<lb break="no"/>greeable rival. He determined, however, 
        			<lb/>were it practicable, once more to see her, 
        			<lb/>and to congratulate her on her union with 
        			<lb/>a better companion, than he could make;—
        			<lb/>or, should she conceive as he once thought 
        			<lb/>she had, a growing affection for him, he 
        			<lb/>should rejoice to find himself, in the road 
        			<lb/>for that happiness, which alone could ren-
        			<lb break="no"/>der his existence satisfactory, or scarcely 
        			<lb/>desirable.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			FOR this purpose, one of her brothers 
        			<lb/>made a fruitless expedition a number of 
        			<lb/>hundred miles to the Eastward among some 
        		    <lb/>of her relations. Her Suitor took his <choice><sic>rout</sic><corr>route</corr></choice> 
        			<lb/>to the Westward. And among his rambles, 
        			<lb/>he visited the seat of war; where he saw 
        			<lb/>his half adorable object of love. But as 
        			<lb/>fortune, adverse or propitious, would have 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>it, he knew not that she who appeared in 
        			<lb/>martial attire, was the tender object, who 
        			<lb/>occupied the most distinguished seat in his 
        			<lb/>bosom. Her eyes were not deceptory; 
        			<lb/>and when she heard the articulation of her 
        			<lb/>name in his enquiries, it was not because 
        			<lb/>she slighted him, nor because she was en-
        			<lb break="no"/>raptured with his love, that she a second 
        			<lb/>time hastened from his presence. The big 
        			<lb/>tear trembled in her eye; and when she 
        			<lb/>turned to conceal her emotions, she silent-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly and reluctantly bid him adieu.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			AFTER many wearisome steps and un-
        			<lb break="no"/>successful researches, he returned home; 
        			<lb/>when it was concluded, that she must have 
        			<lb/>crossed the wide <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>, or have found 
        		    <lb/>an untimely <seg xml:id="a091" corresp="#n091">sepulchre</seg><note xml:id="n091" corresp="#a091"><term style="font-style: italic">Sepulchre</term>: tomb.</note> in her own country.
        			<lb/>—She was preserved; and she only could 
        			<lb/>cure the cruel suspense and racking sensa-
        		    <lb break="no"/>tions, which <choice><sic>would</sic><corr>it would</corr></choice> be brutal to suppose 
        			<lb/>did not pervade their bosoms on this occa-
        			<lb break="no"/>sion. The mind is scarcely capable of pic-
        			<lb break="no"/>turing a contrast more trying to the tender 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>passions than this. And no doubt, she al-
        			<lb break="no"/>lotted her sequestered retirements to in-
        			<lb break="no"/>dulge the sorrowing, unnoticed tear; when 
        			<lb/>the anguish of a mother, of her relatives 
        			<lb/>and of him, whose felicity she knew was 
        			<lb/>perfectly interwoven with her own, took 
        			<lb/>complete possession of her mind together.
        			<lb/>—After striving a long time in vain to ease 
        			<lb/>the distress of her mother, and to exone-
        			<lb break="no"/>rate the too intense burden of her own 
        			<lb/>mind by writing, she found an opportuni-
        			<lb break="no"/>ty, and enclosed to her the substance of 
        			<lb/>the following:

        						<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">virtue</emph>, which I have always been taught to

        						MY place of residence and the adjacent

        			PASSING over many marches, forward 
        			<lb/>and retrograde, and numberless incidental 
        			<lb/>adventures and hardships peculiar to war, I

        		    THE business of war is devastation, <seg xml:id="a096" corresp="#n096">rapine</seg><note xml:id="n096" corresp="#a096"><term style="font-style: italic">Rapine</term>: plunder.</note> 
        		    <lb/>and murder. And in <placeName>America</placeName>, these brutal 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>principles were never more horribly ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>emplified, than in this war. Hence the ne-
        			<lb break="no"/>cessity of scouting; which was the common 
        			<lb/>business of the infantry, to which our HE-
        			<lb break="no"/>ROINE belonged. And some time in <date when="1782-06">June 
        				<lb/>of this year</date>, she, with two sergeants, request-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed leave of their Captain to retaliate on the

        				<lb/>night to be killed, and I have no men to lose</emph>.” 
        			<lb/>He however consented; and they beat for 
        			<lb/>volunteers. Nearly all the company turn-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed out; but only twenty were permitted to 
        			<lb/>go.—Near the close of the day they com-
        			<lb break="no"/>menced their expedition. They passed a 
        			<lb/>number of guards and went as far as <placeName>East-
        				<lb/>Chester</placeName> undiscovered; where they lay in 
        			<lb/>ambush to watch the motions of those, who 
        			<lb/>might be on the plundering business. They 
        			<lb/>quickly discovered that two parties had 
        			<lb/>gone out; and whilst they were contriving 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>how to entrap them, they discovered two 
        			<lb/>boys, who were sent for provisions to a 
        			<lb/>private cellar in the wood. One of them 
        			<lb/>informed, that a party had just been at his 
        			<lb/>mother’s, and were then gone to visit the 
        			<lb/><emph style="font-style: italic">Yankees</emph>, who were guarding the lines. Con-
        			<lb break="no"/>cealing from them that they were Ameri-

        			<lb/>or rather a cave, which they found well 
        			<lb/>stored with provision; such as bacon, butter,

        			ABOUT four in the morning, a large par-
        			<lb break="no"/>ty, chiefly on horseback and well armed, 
        			<lb/>were saluted by one of the centinels; which 
        			<lb/>was no sooner done, than they returned a

        			<lb break="no"/>thing; as she thought it no time to tell of 
        			<lb/>wounds, unless mortal. Coming to a stand, 
        			<lb/>she dismounted, but had not strength to 
        			<lb/>walk, or stand alone. She found her boot 
        			<lb/>on her right leg filled with blood; and 
        			<lb/>in her thigh, just below her groin, she found 
        			<lb/>the incision of a ball, whence it issued.—

        			SHE told one of the sergeants, she was so 
        			<lb/>wounded, she chose rather to be left in 
        			<lb/>that horrid place, than be carried any fur-
        			<lb break="no"/>ther. They all, as one, concluded to car-
        			<lb break="no"/>ry her, in case she could not ride. Here 
        			<lb/>was her trial! A thousand thoughts and 
        			<lb/>spectres at once darted before her. She 
        			<lb/>had always thought she should rather die, 
        			<lb/>than disclose her sex to the army! And at 
        			<lb/>that instant, almost in despair, she drew a 
        			<lb/>pistol from a holster, and was nearly ready 
        			<lb/>to execute the fatal deed. But divine 
        			<lb/>goodness here stayed her hand: and the 
        			<lb/>shocking act and idea of suicide were soon 
        			<lb/>banished by her cooler reason. 
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HAVING rested a little, being destitute of 
        			<lb/>any refreshment, her wounds became exces-
        			<lb break="no"/>sively painful; but nothing we may judge, 
        			<lb/>to the anguish of her mind. Coming in 
        			<lb/>view at length of the French encampment, 
        			<lb/>near what was called <placeName><term style="font­-style: italic">Cron Pond</term></placeName>, she says, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>it was to her like being carried reluctant to 
        			<lb/>the place of execution. They were con-
        			<lb break="no"/>ducted by the officer of the guards to an 
        			<lb/>old hospital, in which was a number of 
        			<lb/>soldiers; whose very looks, she says, were 
        			<lb/>enough to make a well man indisposed, and 
        			<lb/>the nauseous smell, to infect the most pure 
        			<lb/>air. The French surgeon soon came; who, 
        			<lb/>being informed of their circumstances, 
        			<lb/>gave them two bottles of choice wine, and 
        			<lb/>prepared to dress their wounds. His mate, 
        			<lb/>washing her head with rum, told her, he 
        			<lb/>supposed it had not come to its feeling, as 
        			<lb/>she did not flinch. Judge, my readers, 
        			<lb/>whether this was not the case, as her other 
        			<lb/>wound so much affected her heart! She 
        			<lb/>requested the favor of more medicine than 
        			<lb/>she needed for her head; and taking an op-
        			<lb break="no"/>portunity, with a penknife and needle, she 
        			<lb/>extracted the ball from her thigh; which, by 
        			<lb/>that time, had doubtless come to its feeling.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THEY never rightly knew how many they 
        			<lb/>killed or wounded. They took nine pris-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>oners and seven horses, and killed a num-
        			<lb break="no"/>ber of others on the spot. Of their wound-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed was <persName>ROSE</persName>, <persName>STOCKBRIDGE</persName>, <persName>PLUMMER</persName> and 
        			<lb/>the invincible <persName>FAIR</persName>. <persName>DISTON</persName> was killed.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			AFTER suffering almost every pain, but 
        			<lb/>death, with incredible fortitude, she so far 
        			<lb/>healed her wound unbeknown to any, that 
        			<lb/>she again joined the army on the lines. 
        			<lb/>But its imperfect cure, had it been known, 
        			<lb/>would have been sufficient to exempt the 
        			<lb/>most hardy soldier from duty.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IN <date when="1782-08">August</date>, on their march to the lines 
        			<lb/>from <placeName><emph style="font-style: italic">Collabarack</emph></placeName>, she requested to be left 
        			<lb/>with a sick soldier, named <persName>RICHARD SNOW</persName>; 
        			<lb/>mostly because she was unable to do duty 
        			<lb/>with the army, and partly out of compassion 
        			<lb/>for the poor object, who was sick. But 
        			<lb/>the fortune of war to her proved adverse. 
        			<lb/>The fears and distress, that here awaited 
        			<lb/>her, were far greater than those, when with 
        			<lb/>the army. The old Dutchman, whose 
        			<lb/>name was <persName>VANTASSEL</persName>, with whom she 
        			<lb/>was left, was not only a tory and enter-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>tained the banditti, who plundered the A-
        			<lb break="no"/>mericans, but refused them all kinds of 
        			<lb/>succor. When she begged a straw bed for 
        			<lb/>the expiring soldier, he virulently exulted—
        			<lb/>“<emph style="font-style: italic">The floor is good enough for rebels</emph>.” They 
        			<lb/>were lodged in a dirty garret without win-
        			<lb break="no"/>dows; where the heat rendered it still 
        			<lb/>more insupportable.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ONE night, expecting to become a prey 
        			<lb/>to the relentless cruelty of the rabble, she 
        			<lb/>charged both their pieces, resolving to sac-
        			<lb break="no"/>rifice the first who might offer to molest. 
        			<lb/>She likewise made fast a rope near an open-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing in the garret, by which to make her es-
        			<lb break="no"/>cape, in case they should be too many. 
        			<lb/>Thus, she continued constant to him, till 
        			<lb/>almost exhausted for want of sleep and 
        			<lb/>nourishment. On the tenth night, he ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>pired in great agonies, but in the exercise 
        			<lb/>of his reason, (of which he was before de-
        			<lb break="no"/>prived) and much resigned to the will of 
        			<lb/>GOD; which may be a consolation to his 
        			<lb/>surviving relatives.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			AFTER <persName>SNOW</persName> was dead, she rolled him 
        			<lb/>in his blanket and sat at the avenue. She 
        			<lb/>saw a party ride up to the house, and the 
        			<lb/>old churl go out to congratulate them. 
        			<lb/>They informed, the horses they then had, 
        			<lb/>with other plunder, were taken from the 
        			<lb/>Americans. Whilst the house was again 
        			<lb/>infested with their ungodly career, it is not 
        			<lb/>in my power to describe her melancholy 
        			<lb/>distress in a dark garret with a corpse. A 
        			<lb/>multitude of cats swarmed in the room; and 
        			<lb/>it was with difficulty she disabled some with 
        			<lb/>her cutlass, and kept the rest from tearing 
        			<lb/>the body to pieces. At length, she heard 
        			<lb/>footsteps on the stairs. Her heart flutter-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed; but her heroism had not forsaken her. 
        			<lb/>Hastening to the door, she put her hanger 
        			<lb/>in a position to dislocate the limbs of any 
        			<lb/>who should enter. But the voice of a fe-
        			<lb break="no"/>male, who spoke to her in English, allayed 
        			<lb/>her fear. It was <persName>VANTASSEL’s</persName> daughter, 
        			<lb/>who seemed possessed of humanity, and who 
        			<lb/>had before often alleviated her distress.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			AT day-break, she left the garret; but find-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing the outer doors bolted, she was return-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing, when she again met the young female, 
        			<lb/>who bid her good morning, and said—“If 
        			<lb/>you please, Sir, walk into my chamber.” 
        			<lb/>She followed; and seating themselves by a 
        			<lb/>window, they regaled themselves with a 
        			<lb/>glass of wine and a beautiful, serene air. 
        			<lb/>After entreating her agreeable guest not to 
        			<lb/>let the ill treatment she had received from 
        			<lb/>her father make her forsake the house, she 
        			<lb/>bordered on subjects that might have en-
        			<lb break="no"/>raptured the other sex.—Summoned at this 
        			<lb/>instant by her mother, they withdrew.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			OUR HEROINE, with the assistance of two 
        			<lb/>others, buried the dead; then sat out to 
        			<lb/>join her company. She acquainted the 
        			<lb/>Captain of the toryism of <persname>VANTASSEL</persname>, of 
        			<lb/>his treatment of her, and thought it best to 
        			<lb/>surprise him. The affair was submitted to 
        			<lb/>her management. She frequented the 
        			<lb/>house; and having learned that a gang was 
        			<lb/>to be there at such a time, she took com-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>mand of a party and found them in their 
        			<lb/>usual reverie. Some thought best to rush 
        			<lb/>immediately upon them; but she deemed 
        			<lb/>it more prudent to wait till their intoxicated 
        			<lb/>brains should render them less capable of 
        			<lb/>resistance. At midnight, she unbolted the 
        			<lb/>stable doors, when they possessed themselves 
        			<lb/>of the horses; then rallied the house. They 
        			<lb/>came out with consternation; which was 
        			<lb/>increased when they were told, they were 
        			<lb/>dead men if they did not yield themselves 
        			<lb/>prisoners of war. They conveyed them to 
        			<lb/>their company as such. The Captain en-
        			<lb break="no"/>quired of the gallant Commander, the me-
        			<lb break="no"/>thod of capturing them; which she detail-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed. He gave her a bottle of good spirits 
        			<lb/>and told her to treat her men. This done, 
        			<lb/>she requested, that the prisoners might fare 
        			<lb/>in like manner. The Captain said—“Will 
        			<lb/>you treat men who would be glad to mur-
        			<lb break="no"/>der us?” But she pleading the cause of hu-
        			<lb break="no"/>manity, he gave her another bottle. <choice><sic>Unlosing</sic><corr>Un-
        				<lb break="no"/>loosing</corr></choice> the hands of a sergeant, he drank, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>but in making them fast again, he acted on 
        			<lb/>the defensive, and struck her to the ground. 
        			<lb/>She arose, when he made a second attempt; 
        			<lb/>but she warded the blow. His compeers 
        			<lb/>chided him for his folly, as they had been 
        			<lb/>well used. He vented many bitter oaths; 
        			<lb/>alledging, she had not only taken him pris-
        			<lb break="no"/>oner, but had caused his girl (meaning 
        			<lb/><persName>VANTASSEL’s</persName> daughter) to pay that atten-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion to her, she once bestowed on him. He, 
        			<lb/>however, received fifty stripes on the na-
        			<lb break="no"/>ked back for his insolence; then was sent 
        			<lb/>to Head Quarters, and after trial, to the

        		<p>
        			THE beginning of Autumn, she, with 
        			<lb/><persName>Lieut. BROWN</persName> and others, had a boister-
        			<lb break="no"/>ous cruise down <placeName>the Hudson</placeName> to <placeName>Albany</placeName> on 
        			<lb/>business; soon after, a scouting tour into 
        			<lb/><placeName>the Jersies</placeName>; and she was with the armies 
        			<lb/>on the <date when="1782-10-19">19th of October</date> in their grand Dis-
        			<lb break="no"/>play at <placeName>Virplank’s Point</placeName>. I only instance 
        			<lb/>these as parties of pleasure and a day of 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>jubilee, when compared with the rougher 
        			<lb/>events of war.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			WE come now to the <date when="1782-12-01">first of December</date>, 
        			<lb/>when she and a party were surprised by a 
        			<lb/>party of Dutch cavalry from an ambuscade 
        			<lb/>and drove with impetuosty to <placeName>Croton</placeName> Fer-
        			<lb break="no"/>ry; where their only alternative was that 
        			<lb/>of fording it, or of risking their lives with 
        			<lb/>the assailants: each of which seemed to the 
        			<lb/>last degree dangerous. Without time for 
        			<lb/>hesitation, compelling a Dutchman to pilot 
        			<lb/>them on the bar, they entered the watery 
        			<lb/>element; and by the assistance of that BE-
        			<lb break="no"/>ING, who is said to have conducted the Is-
        			<lb break="no"/>raelites through the <placeName>Red Sea</placeName>, they reached 
        			<lb/>the other shore.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THEY went to the house of the Widow 
        			<lb/><persName>HUNT</persName>; who, under pretentions of friend-
        			<lb break="no"/>ship, sent black <emph style="font-style: italic"><persName>George</persName></emph> for refreshment. But 
        			<lb/>our Heroine, more acquainted with the 
        			<lb/>cunning of her sex, advised them not to ad-
        			<lb break="no"/>here to her smoothness of speech. Accord-
        			<lb break="no"/>ingly, they went back to the ferry; and 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>they can best describe the wretchedness of 
        			<lb/>their situation during a cold winter night. 
        			<lb/>In the morning, though the river was fro-
        			<lb break="no"/>zen, they determined to recross it; lest the 
        			<lb/>enemy should drive them to a worse ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>tremity. Before they had two-thirds cross-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed, the strength of our young FEMALE was 
        			<lb/>so exhausted, that the briskness of the 
        			<lb/>stream, which was in height to her chin, 
        			<lb/>carried her off the bar; when it was con-
        			<lb break="no"/>cluded, she was for ever ingulphed in a 
        			<lb/>watery tomb. As she rose, summoning the 
        			<lb/>last exertions of nature, she got hold of a 
        			<lb/>string, which they buoyed to her; and thus, 
        			<lb/>providentially, regained the bar and shore. 
        			<lb/>Frozen and languid as they then were, they 
        			<lb/>reached a store; where not being well used, 
        			<lb/>they burst in the head of a brandy cask, 
        			<lb/>drank their fill, gave a shoe full to the ne-
        			<lb break="no"/>gro of the widow, whom they had before 
        			<lb/>taken; then left him in a better situation 
        			<lb/>than he said, his mistress meant to have left 
        			<lb/>them. She rendezvoused with her compa-
        			<lb break="no"/>ny at <placeName>Pixkill Hollow</placeName>.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			SOON after the army retired to Winter 
        			<lb/>Quarters at <placeName>New Windsor</placeName>, the clarion of 
        			<lb/>war was again sounded for a reinforcement 
        			<lb/>to assist <persName>Gen. SCHUYLER</persName> in subduing the In-
        			<lb break="no"/>dians on the frontiers, on to <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>. The 
        			<lb/>officers chose to form their detachment of 
        			<lb/>volunteers; as the soldiers were worn 
        			<lb/>down with the hardships of war. Heavens! 
        			<lb/>what will not resolution and perseverance 
        			<lb/>surmount, even in the <emph style="font-style: italic">fair</emph> sex!—Our He-
        			<lb break="no"/>roine offered her service; though an in-
        			<lb break="no"/>flammation of her wound would have de-
        			<lb break="no"/>terred a veteran: it being an open sore a 
        			<lb/>few days before she crossed the river.  
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THEIR marches were over the ruins of 
        			<lb/>Indian barbarity. On their return, they 
        			<lb/>flanked into parties, and took different 
        		    <lb/><choice><sic>routs</sic><corr>routes</corr></choice> through the wilderness. She was in 
        			<lb/>a party commanded by <persName>Capt. MILLS</persName>. Not 
        			<lb/>far from <placeName>Bradport</placeName>, an English settlement, 
        			<lb/>the snow having fallen three feet deep, 
        			<lb/>they saw a man fleeing for his life. On en-
        			<lb break="no"/>quiry, he informed, that the Indians had 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>surrounded his house, and were then in the 
        			<lb/>heat of their butchery. Hastening with 
        			<lb/>him to the place, they found the infernals 
        			<lb/>had not finished their hellish sacrifices. 
        			<lb/>The house was on fire, his wife mangled 
        			<lb/>and lay bleeding on the threshold. Two 
        			<lb/>children were hung by their heels; one 
        			<lb/>scalped, and yet alive; the other dead, with 
        			<lb/>a tamahawk in its brains. They took them. 
        			<lb/>Females, have fortitude. The dauntless of 
        			<lb/>your sex thrust her hand into the bosom of 
        			<lb/>one, and rent his vesture. The effect was the 
        			<lb/>discovery of his being of the complexion 
        			<lb/>of an Englishman, except where he was 
        			<lb/>painted. They sent him to Head Quar-
        			<lb break="no"/>ters; but executed the rest on the spot.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BEFORE they reached the army, their 
        			<lb/>feet once more crimsoned the snow—a to-
        			<lb break="no"/>ken of their sufferings. But her name re-
        		    <lb break="no"/>sounded with <seg xml:id="a101" corresp="#n101">plaudits;</seg><note xml:id="n101" corresp="#a101"><term style="font-style: italic">Plaudits</term>: applause.</note> which would have 
        			<lb/>been enhanced, had the discovery of her 
        			<lb/>sex then taken place.

        		<p>
        			IN the Spring of <date when="1783">1783</date>, peace began 
        			<lb/>to be the general topic; and which was ac-
        			<lb break="no"/>tually announced to Congress. A build-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing was erected; in which the officers held 
        			<lb/>their concerts. It would contain a brigade 
        			<lb/>at a time for the exercise of public wor-
        			<lb break="no"/>ship. The timber was cut and drawn to-
        			<lb break="no"/>gether by the soldiers, and mostly sawn by 
        			<lb/>hand. Our Heroine worked against any 
        			<lb/>hardy soldier, without any advantage in her 
        			<lb/>yoke. In its raising, a joist fell and carri-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed her from a considerable height to the 
        			<lb/>ground; but without doing any essential 
        			<lb/>injury, except the dislocation of her nose 
        			<lb/>and ancle.

        			ON the <date when="1783-04-01">first of April</date>, <persName>Gen. PATTERSON</persName> 
        			<lb/>selected her for his Waiter; as he had pre-
        			<lb break="no"/>viously become acquainted with her hero-
        			<lb break="no"/>ism and fidelity. Cessation of hostilities was 
        			<lb/>proclaimed on the <date when="1783-04-19">19th</date>. The honorary 
        			<lb/>badge of distinction, as established by <persName>Gen. 
        				<lb/>WASHINGTON</persName>, had been conferred on 
        			<lb/>her; but for what particular exploit, I 
        			<lb/>cannot say. Her business was here much 
        			<lb/>less intense; and she found a superior 
        			<lb/>school for improvement.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE General’s attachment towards his 
        			<lb/>new attendant was daily increasing. Her 
        			<lb/>martial deportment, blended with the mild-
        			<lb break="no"/>er graces and vivacity of her sex and youth, 
        			<lb/>filled him with admiration and wonder. 
        			<lb/>Anxious to avail himself of every advan-
        			<lb break="no"/>tage to inspire his troops with emulation in 
        			<lb/>the cause of their country; it is said, per-
        			<lb break="no"/>haps justly, that when he saw a delinquen-
        			<lb break="no"/>cy or faint-heartedness in his men, he often 
        			<lb/>referred them to some heroic achievement 
        		    <lb/>of his <seg xml:id="a102" corresp="#n102"><emph style="font-style: italic">smockfaced boy</emph>,</seg><note xml:id="n102" corresp="#a102"><term style="font-style: italic">Smockfaced</term>: an 18C expression for girlishness.</note> or convinced them by 
        			<lb/>an ocular example.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			KNOWING she had his commendations, 
        			<lb/>she found new stimulations for perseve-
        			<lb break="no"/>rance. And scarcely any injunctions 
        			<lb/>would have been too severe for her com-
        			<lb break="no"/>pliance. Hence it seems, he was led to 
        			<lb/>conceive that such an assemblage of cour-
        			<lb break="no"/>age and refinement could exist but in the 
        			<lb/>superior order of his sex; and that such a 
        			<lb/>youth was highly calculated to shine either 
        			<lb/>in the sphere of war, or in the profession of 
        			<lb/>a gentleman of taste and philosophic refine-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment.

        		    THUS, Females, whilst you see the <seg xml:id="a103" corresp="#n103">avid-

        			<lb break="no"/>gers and made a veteran example in <emph style="font-style: italic">war</emph>,

        		<p>
        			GENERAL orders were, every warm sea-
        			<lb break="no"/>son, for the soldiers to go into the water, as 
        			<lb/>well to exercise themselves in the art of 
        			<lb/>swimming, as to clean their bodies. These 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>injunctions were so directly in point, that 
        			<lb/>her compliance with them would unavoid-
        			<lb break="no"/>ably have been unbosoming the delicate se-
        			<lb break="no"/>cret. To have pled indisposition would 
        			<lb/>have been an argument against her; as the 
        			<lb/>cold bath might have wrought her cure: 
        			<lb/>and to have intimated cowardice, would 
        			<lb/>have entitled her to less lenity, than when 
        			<lb/>before in the Ferry. So, after lying awake 
        			<lb/>the first night, she concluded to be the first 
        			<lb/>to rise at roll-call. Accordingly, the re-
        			<lb break="no"/>giment paraded and marched to the river. 
        			<lb/>She was expert in undressing with the rest. 
        			<lb/>After they were mostly in the water, what 
        			<lb/>should ravish her ear but the sound of a 
        			<lb/>sweet fountain, that percolated over a high 
        			<lb/>rock near the river’s brink. It was thickly 
        			<lb/>enclosed with the aspen and alder. Thith-
        			<lb break="no"/>er she unnoticed retired. And whilst <placeName>the 
        				<lb/>Hudson</placeName> swelled with the multitude of mas-
        			<lb break="no"/>culine bodies, a beautiful rivulet answered 
        			<lb/>every purpose of bathing a more delicate 
        			<lb/>form. Nor were there any old, letcher-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>ous, sanctified Elders to peep through the 
        			<lb/>rustling leaves to be inflamed with her 
        			<lb/>charms.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ONE more incident may amuse those 
        			<lb/>ladies, who are fond of angling.—One day, 
        			<lb/>she, with some others, at the ebb of tide, 
        			<lb/>went to <placeName>the Hudson</placeName> for this purpose. Near 
        			<lb/>the boat, she discovered a beautiful azure 
        			<lb/>rock, well situated for fishing. Too care-
        			<lb break="no"/>less of her famed predecessor’s disposition, 
        			<lb/>she disembarked from the boat to the rock. 
        			<lb/>Soon after, they purposely weighed anchor 
        			<lb/>and left her surrounded with water. She 
        			<lb/>continued not long, before, to her surprise, 
        			<lb/>as well as the rest, the rock became a self 
        			<lb/>moving vehicle, and sat out to overtake 
        			<lb/>her company. Dreading the passage, she 
        			<lb/>leaped into the water and mire, and had 
        			<lb/>many severe struggles before she reached 
        			<lb/>land. The rock proved a prodigious Tor-
        			<lb break="no"/>toise. And lest antiquity should not be 
        			<lb/>cured of credulity and superstition, there-
        			<lb break="no"/>by enhance the prodigy to their generation—
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>that a <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph> was once a navigator on the 
        			<lb/>back of a Tortoise, that he finally swallow-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed her and some time after spouted her 
        			<lb/>alive on the fertile land;—it is only need-
        		    <lb break="no"/>ful to mention that they <seg xml:id="a104" corresp="#n104">gaffed him,</seg><note xml:id="n104" corresp="#a104"><term style="font-style: italic">Gaffed</term>: speared.</note> with

        			<lb break="no"/>val, ate him.

        		<p>
        			THIS Summer a detachment of 1500 
        			<lb/>men was ordered to march to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> 
        		    <lb/>for the suppression of a <seg xml:id="a105" corresp="#n105">mutiny among the 
        		        <lb/>American soldiers.</seg><note xml:id="n105" corresp="#a105"><term style="font-style: italic">Mutiny</term>: a <date when="1783">1783</date> action by Continental Army soldiers demanding payment; soldiers surrounded the assembled Congress, leading to their evacuation to <placeName>Princeton, New Jersey</placeName>.</note> She did not go till 
        			<lb/>four days after the General left <placeName>West Point</placeName>. 
        			<lb/>She then rode in company with four gen-
        			<lb break="no"/>tlemen, and had a richly variegated prospect 
        			<lb/>through <placeName>the Jersies</placeName> and a part of <placeName>Pennsyl-
        				<lb break="no"/>vania</placeName>. In <placeName>Goshen</placeName> they were invited to a 
        			<lb/>ball; where she was pleased to see, espe-
        			<lb break="no"/>cially in the ladies, the brilliancy and po-
        			<lb break="no"/>liteness of those in <placeName>New England</placeName>. They 
        			<lb/>were here detained two days on account of 
        			<lb/><persName>Lieut. STONE</persName>, who was confined for a duel 
        			<lb/>with <persName>Capt. HITCHCOCK</persName>, who was killed. 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>She found the troops encamped on a hill; 
        			<lb/>from which, they had a fine prospect of the 
        			<lb/>city and of the <placeName>Allegany</placeName>, which rises ma-
        			<lb break="no"/>jestic over the intervening country. Here 
        			<lb/>she had frequent occasion to visit the city, 
        			<lb/>sometimes on business, and often curiosity 
        			<lb/>led her to view its magnificence. The gen-
        			<lb break="no"/>tility of her dress and agreeable mien gain-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed her access to company of both sexes of 
        			<lb/>rank and elegance.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE storm of war having subsided, an 
        			<lb/>agreeable prospect once more gleamed on 
        			<lb/>the face of <persName>COLUMBIA</persName>. But fortune had 
        			<lb/>more dangers and toils assigned her. An 
        		    <lb/>epidemic <seg xml:id="a106" corresp="#n106">disorder raged in the city:</seg><note xml:id="n106" corresp="#a106"><term style="font-style: italic">Disorder</term>: a scarlet fever outbreak.</note> and 
        			<lb/>she was quickly selected a victim, and car-
        			<lb break="no"/>ried once more to the hospital with all the 
        			<lb/>horrible apprehensions of her situation. 
        			<lb/>Death itself could scarcely have presented 
        			<lb/>a more gloomy prospect: and that seemed 
        			<lb/>not far distant; as multitudes were daily 
        		    <lb/>carried to the <seg xml:id="a107" corresp="#n107"><placeName>Potter’s Field</placeName>.</seg><note xml:id="n107" corresp="#a107"><term style="font-style: italic"><placeName>Potter’s Field</placeName></term>: a burial ground for the poor and anonymous.</note> She begged 
        			<lb/>not to be left in the loathsome bunks of 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>soldiers. Accordingly, she was lodged in a 
        			<lb/>third loft, where were two other officers 
        			<lb/>of the same line, who soon died. Alone 
        			<lb/>she was then left to condole her wretched-
        			<lb break="no"/>ness: except <persName>Doctor BANA</persName> and the Mat-
        			<lb break="no"/>ron, <persName>Mrs. PARKER</persName>, whose solicitude she re-
        			<lb break="no"/>members with gratitude.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HOW poignantly must reflection have 
        			<lb/>here brought to her memory those soft and 
        			<lb/>tranquil seasons, wherein she so often de-
        			<lb break="no"/>prived herself the midsummer’s morning 
        			<lb/>dream, to breathe with the lark the fresh 
        			<lb/>incense of morning!—when with hasty 
        			<lb/>steps she brushed the dews from vegetation, 
        			<lb/>to meet the sun on the rising grounds: by 
        			<lb/>which, to catch fresh hints of CREATION, 
        			<lb/>and to inhale thee, buxom HEALTH, from 
        			<lb/>every opening flower! But she is now, not 
        			<lb/>indeed, like Egyptian mummies, wrapped 
        			<lb/>in fine linen and laid on beds of spices, 
        			<lb/>but on the naked floor, anticipating the 
        			<lb/>Archer, Death, in all the frightful forms of 
        			<lb/>his equipage.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			BUT at length, she was deprived of the 
        			<lb/>faculty of reflection. The Archer was a-
        			<lb break="no"/>bout to execute his last office. The inhu-
        			<lb break="no"/>man sextons had drawn their allowance, and 
        			<lb/>upon her vesture they were casting lots. One 
        			<lb/><persName>JONES</persName>, the only English nurse, at that in-
        			<lb break="no"/>stant coming in, she once more rallied the 
        			<lb/>small remains of nature and gave signs of 
        		    <lb/>life. The <seg xml:id="a108" corresp="#n108">sextons</seg><note xml:id="n108" corresp="#a108"><term style="font-style: italic">Sextons</term>: Church officers often tasked with grave digging.</note> withdrew, and <persName>JONES</persName> 
        			<lb/>informed the Matron such a one was yet 
        			<lb/>alive; which she discredited. <persName>Doctor BA-
        				<lb break="no"/>NA</persName> at that instant entered; and putting his 
        			<lb/>hand in her bosom to feel her pulse, was 
        			<lb/>surprised to find an inner waist-coat tightly 
        			<lb/>compressing her breasts. Ripping it in 
        			<lb/>haste, he was still more shocked, not only 
        			<lb/>on finding life, but the breasts and other to-
        			<lb break="no"/>kens of a <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph>. Immediately she was re-
        			<lb break="no"/>moved into the Matron’s own apartment; 
        			<lb/>and from that time to her recovery, treat-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed with all the care, that art and expense 
        			<lb/>could bestow.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE amiable Physician had the prudence 
        			<lb/>to conceal this important discovery from 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>every breast but the Matron. From that 
        			<lb/>time, the once more discovered <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph> be-
        			<lb break="no"/>came a welcome guest in their families. 
        			<lb/>And they recommended her to others, as 
        			<lb/>an object worthy their attention and affec-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion.—But there remains another event, 
        			<lb/>perhaps, the most unparalleled of its kind, 
        			<lb/>to be unfolded.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			A YOUNG lady of the suburbs of <placeName>Balti-
        				<lb break="no"/>more</placeName>, beautiful in form, blest with a well cul-
        			<lb break="no"/>tivated mind, and a fortune, had often con-
        			<lb break="no"/>versed with this illustrious <emph style="font-style: italic">soldier</emph>. The 
        			<lb/>gracefulness of her mien, mixed with her 
        			<lb/>dignified, martial airs, enraptured her. 
        			<lb/>At first, she attempted to check the im-
        			<lb break="no"/>pulse, as the effect of a giddy passion; but 
        			<lb/>at length suffered it to play about her 
        			<lb/>heart unchided. <persName>Cupid</persName>, impatient, at 
        			<lb/>length urged his quiver too far, and wound-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed the seat of love.—O Love! how pow-
        			<lb break="no"/>erful is your influence! how unlimited 
        			<lb/>your domain! The gallant <persName>SOLOMON</persName> could 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>not have composed three thousand prov-
        			<lb break="no"/>erbs and his madrigals to his love, without 
        			<lb/>much of your conviviality. The illumina-
        			<lb break="no"/>tions of <persName>Venus</persName> were known in those days. 
        			<lb/>And it was by her rays, the Preacher of 
        			<lb/>love so often strolled with his Egyptian 
        			<lb/>belles in his vineyard, when the flowers ap-
        			<lb break="no"/>peared on the earth, the mandrakes gave a 
        			<lb/>good smell, and the time of the singing of 
        			<lb/>birds had come; when they reciprocated 
        			<lb/>their love amidst the dews of dawn.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			SUFFICIENT it is, that this love is pre-
        			<lb break="no"/>served, and that it will remain incontro-
        			<lb break="no"/>vertible. And happy it is, that it is not only 
        			<lb/>enjoyed by the prince of the inner pavill-
        			<lb break="no"/>ion. It leaps upon the mountains; and, 
        			<lb/>under the shadow of the apple tree, it is 
        			<lb/>sweet to the taste. From the moss-covered 
        			<lb/>cottage, it is pursued, even amidst the thun-
        			<lb break="no"/>ders of war and the distraction of elements. 
        			<lb/>And the nymph of <placeName>Maryland</placeName> was as much 
        			<lb/>entitled to it, as the mistress of him, who 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>had the caressing of a thousand. Hers was 
        			<lb/>sentimental and established: and she was 
        			<lb/>miserable from the thought that it might 
        			<lb/>not be interchangeable.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ON this account, the productions of her 
        			<lb/>plantation were no longer relished with 
        			<lb/>pleasure. The music of her groves became 
        			<lb/>dissonant, her grottos too solitary, and the 
        			<lb/>rivulets purled but for her discontent. 
        			<lb/>From these she flew in search of him, whom 
        			<lb/>her soul loved, among the bustling roar of 
        			<lb/>the city. And the third morning after she 
        			<lb/>was confined in the hospital, a courier de-
        			<lb break="no"/>livered her a letter and a handkerchief full 
        			<lb/>of choice fruit. Inclosed was the substance of the following:

        							<lb break="no"/>peated interviews with you kindled it into a flame, 
        							<lb/>I do not now blush to own: and should it meet a

        			<lb break="no"/>ney; owing to a prize she in company had

        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>every zephyr became an ill-fated omen and 
        			<lb/>every salutation, a mandate to summon her 
        			<lb/>to a retribution for her imposition on the 
        			<lb/>masculine character.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			SUCH embarrassments foreboded the wind-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing up of her drama. And she was doubt-
        			<lb break="no"/>less careful to picture the event in the black-
        			<lb break="no"/>est colours. A retrospection of her life 
        			<lb/>must have brought, to her mind, a con-
        			<lb break="no"/>trast, unknown to many and dreaded by all. 
        			<lb/>But having stood at helm during the sever-
        			<lb break="no"/>ity of the storm, she concluded, if a con-
        			<lb break="no"/>cession must be extorted from her, it might 
        			<lb/>appear less dastardly after a beautiful, se-
        			<lb break="no"/>rene DAY had commenced: And that it 
        			<lb/>mattered little, whether it should happen 
        			<lb/>among the insatiable throng of the city, or 
        			<lb/>the ruder few of the desolate heath.—Thus 
        			<lb/>the lioness, having pervaded every toil and 
        			<lb/>danger, from the hounds and hunters, at 
        			<lb/>length, cornered on all sides, disdaining 
        			<lb/>their fury, yields herself a prey.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			<persName>DOCTOR BANA</persName> was now waiting a con-
        			<lb break="no"/>venient opportunity to divulge to her his 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>suspicion of her sex. He often found her 
        			<lb/>dejected; and as he guessed the cause, intro-
        			<lb break="no"/>duced lively discourse. She had the happi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ness to recommend herself much to the es-
        			<lb break="no"/>teem of his discreet and amiable daughters. 
        			<lb/>And the Doctor was fond that so promis-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing a <emph style="font-style: italic">stripling</emph> should often gallant them in-
        			<lb break="no"/>to the city and country villages. The un-
        			<lb break="no"/>ruffled surface of a summer’s sea was also 
        			<lb/>often a witness to their pastimes. This 
        			<lb/>rare species of innocent recreation was, 
        			<lb/>doubtless, peculiarly gratifying to the Doc-
        			<lb break="no"/>tor; as his mind could not be more at rest 
        			<lb/>on his daughters’ account. Nor need they 
        		    <lb/>think themselves <seg xml:id="a110" corresp="#n110">chagrined,</seg><note xml:id="n110" corresp="#a110"><term style="font-style: italic">Chagrined</term>: disappointed.</note> when it is 
        			<lb/>known they once had a female gallant; on the 
        			<lb/>strength of whose arm and sword they would 
        			<lb/>have depended in case of danger.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        		    AFTER she had resumed her <seg xml:id="a111" corresp="#n111">regimentals</seg><note xml:id="n111" corresp="#a111"><term style="font-style: italic">Regimentals</term>: uniform of her regiment.</note> 
        			<lb/>to rejoin the troops, the Doctor, availing 
        			<lb/>himself of a private conference, asked her, 
        			<lb/>whether she had any particular confident 
        			<lb/>in the army? She said, no; and trembling, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>would have disclosed the secret: but he, 
        			<lb/>seeing her confusion, waived the discourse. 
        			<lb/>To divert her mind, he proposed her taking 
        			<lb/>a tour towards <placeName>the Ohio</placeName> with <persName>Col. TUPPER</persName> 
        			<lb/>of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, Messrs. <persName>FORKSON</persName> and 
        			<lb/><persName>GRAHAM</persName> of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>; who were going, 
        			<lb/>partly to contemplate the country and part-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly to discover minerals. Knowing the min-
        			<lb break="no"/>eral rods were peculiar to her, he said, 
        			<lb/>whilst the tour might be profitable, it might 
        			<lb/>be a restorative to her health, and an a-
        			<lb break="no"/>musement to her mind.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			SURPRISED to find this met her concur-
        			<lb break="no"/>rence, he used some arguments to dissuade 
        			<lb/>her from it: But finding her unequivocal, 
        			<lb/>he enjoined it upon her to visit his house 
        			<lb/>at her return; which she promised. And 
        			<lb/>about the last of August, they set out from 
        			<lb/>the <emph style="font-style: italic">Conastoga Waggon</emph> and went, in the stage, 
        			<lb/>the first day, to <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, which is eighty 
        			<lb/>miles.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			NEXT day, as she was viewing the town, 
        			<lb/>she received a billet requesting her compa-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>ny at such a place. Though confident she 
        			<lb/>had before seen the hand writing, she could 
        			<lb/>not conjecture what was commencing. 
        			<lb/>Prompted by curiosity, she went; and be-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing conducted into an elegant room, was 
        			<lb/>struck with admiration, on finding alone, 
        			<lb/>the amiable and all accomplished <persName>Miss 
        				<lb/>——</persName>, of about seventeen, whom she had 
        			<lb/>long thought a conspicuous ornament to her 
        			<lb/>sex. The lady expressed surprise on see-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing <emph style="font-style: italic">him</emph>, who, according to report, had died 
        			<lb/>soon after she left the metropolis. An ac-
        			<lb break="no"/>quaintance being before established, mu-
        			<lb break="no"/>tual compliments passed between the lov-
        			<lb break="no"/>ers. The young lady confessed herself au-
        			<lb break="no"/>thor of the anonymous letter. And though 
        		    <lb/>uncertain of a concession—<seg xml:id="a112" corresp="#n112">timorous as a 
        		        <lb/>young roe, yet pliant as the bending ozier,</seg><note xml:id="n112" corresp="#a112"><term style="font-style: italic">Timorous as a young roe</term>: apprehensive as a young small female deer; <term style="font-style: italic">Pliant as the bending ozier</term>: flexible as a bending willow stalk.</note> 
        			<lb/>with the queen of love resident in her <choice><orig>eye</orig><reg>eyes</reg></choice>, 
        			<lb/>she rehearsed her plaint of love with that 
        			<lb/>unreservedness which evinced the sincerity 
        			<lb/>of her passion and exaltedness of soul. The 
        			<lb/>soul is the emporium of love.—Their 
        			<lb/>blushes and palpitations were, doubtless, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>reciprocal; but, I judge, of a different na-
        			<lb break="no"/>ture. But while this liberal concession was 
        			<lb/>the strongest evidence, that she possessed 
        			<lb/>love, without desire of prostitution, and 
        			<lb/>friendship without dissimulation; let it be 
        			<lb/>remembered, to her honor, that her effu-
        			<lb break="no"/>sions flowed with that affability, prudence 
        			<lb/>and dignified grace, which must have fired 
        		    <lb/>the breast of an <seg xml:id="a113" corresp="#n113">anchorite</seg><note xml:id="n113" corresp="#a113"><term style="font-style: italic">Anchorite</term>: a religious recluse.</note>—inanimate na-
        			<lb break="no"/>ture itself must have waked into life, and 
        			<lb/>even the superstitious, cowled friar must 
        			<lb/>have revoked his eternal vows of celibacy, 
        			<lb/>and have flown to the embraces of an ob-
        			<lb break="no"/>ject, exhibiting so many charms in her elo-
        			<lb break="no"/>quence of love.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THUS, ye delicate, who would be candi-
        			<lb break="no"/>dates for the fruition of this noble, this an-
        			<lb break="no"/>gelic passion, it is refinement only, that ren-
        			<lb break="no"/>ders your beauty amiable, and even unre-
        			<lb break="no"/>servedness, in either sex, agreeable. The 
        			<lb/>reverse is only a happy circumstance be-
        			<lb break="no"/>tween vice and virtue. While it there 
        			<lb/>happily preys on every delicate sensation, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>it renders the idea of enjoyment loathsome, 
        			<lb/>and even hurries delicacy herself into dis-
        			<lb break="no"/>tress.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HAD this unfortunate lover uttered her-
        			<lb break="no"/>self in an uncouth, illiterate, unpolished 
        			<lb/>manner, every word would have lost its 
        			<lb/>energy and all her charms become vapid 
        			<lb/>on the senses.—Or, had she assumed the at-
        			<lb break="no"/>tire—the cunning of an harlot—the despe-
        			<lb break="no"/>rate simplicity of a young wanton; had she 
        			<lb/>begun her subtle eloquence with a kiss; 
        			<lb/>and with the poison of asps under her 
        			<lb/>tongue, have represented her bed of em-
        			<lb break="no"/>broidery filled with perfume, and finally 
        			<lb/>have urged that the absence of the good 
        			<lb/>man gave them ,an opportunity to riot in 
        			<lb/>the extatic delights of love—while our young 
        			<lb/>fugitive would have needed supernatural 
        			<lb/>means to have answered the demands of 
        		    <lb/><seg xml:id="a114" corresp="#n114">venerious</seg><note xml:id="n114" corresp="#a114"><term style="font-style: italic">Venerious</term>: relating to sexual intercourse.</note> appetition, the simple might have

        			<lb/>would have continued on her throne in sul-
        			<lb break="no"/>len sadness. But this was not the case. 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>Though suspended between natural and 
        			<lb/>artificial confusion—though sickness had 
        			<lb/>abated her acuteness for the soft roman-
        			<lb break="no"/>ces of love; she doubtless embraced the 
        			<lb/>celestial maid, and wishing herself mistress of 
        			<lb/>her superior charms, could not but parti-
        			<lb break="no"/>cipate in the genial warmth of a passion so 
        			<lb/>irresistibly managed. Knowledge inter-
        			<lb break="no"/>mixed with beauty and refinement, en-
        			<lb break="no"/>kindles a warmth of the purest love; and, 
        			<lb/>like the centre of the earth, commands the 
        			<lb/>power of attraction. She tarried in this 
        			<lb/>school of animal philosophy the most of 
        			<lb/>two days; then promising to visit her in 
        			<lb/>her return, proceeded on her journey. 
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			FROM <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, passing <placeName>Elk Ridge</placeName>, 
        			<lb/>they came to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>. Nine 
        			<lb/>miles below, is <placeName>Mount Vernon</placeName>, the seat 
        			<lb/>of the illustrious <persName>WASHINGTON</persName>, which 
        			<lb/>they visited. It is situated rear a bend in 
        			<lb/>the <placeName>Potomak</placeName>; where it is two miles wide. 
        			<lb/>The area of the mount is 200 feet above 
        			<lb/>the surface of the river. On either wing, is 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>a thick grove of flowering trees. Paral-
        			<lb break="no"/>lel with them, are two spacious gardens, 
        			<lb/>adorned with serpentine gravel walks, 
        			<lb/>planted with weeping willows and shady 
        			<lb/>shrubs. The mansion house is venerable 
        			<lb/>and convenient. A lofty dome, 96 feet 
        			<lb/>in length, supported by eight pillars, has a 
        			<lb/>pleasing effect when viewed from the wa-
        			<lb break="no"/>ter. This, with the assemblage of the 
        			<lb/>green house, offices and servant’s halls, 
        			<lb/>bears the resemblance of a rural village; 
        			<lb/>especially as the grass plats are interspersed 
        			<lb/>with little copses, circular clumps and sin-
        			<lb break="no"/>gle trees. A small park on the margin of 
        			<lb/>the river, where the English fallow deer 
        			<lb/>and the American wild deer are alternate-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly seen through the thickets by passen-
        			<lb break="no"/>gers on the river, adds a romantic and pic-
        			<lb break="no"/>turesque prospect to the whole scenery. 
        			<lb/>Such are the philosophic shades to which 
        			<lb/>the <persName>late Commander of the American Ar-
        				<lb break="no"/>mies, and President of the nation</persName>, has 
        			<lb/>now retired, from a tumultuous and busy 
        			<lb/>world.

        			THEIR next route was to the southwestern

        			NEXT day, the weather was calm. They

        			<lb/>caution. One of the Indians, observing 
        			<lb/>this, ran to her, fired his arrow over her 
        			<lb/>head, took a wreath of wampum, twined it 
        			<lb/>about her waist, and bade her follow. She 
        			<lb/>obeyed; though they checked her presump-
        			<lb break="no"/>tion. They conducted her to a cave; 
        			<lb/>which, she thinks, is as great a natural curi-
        			<lb break="no"/>osity, as that of <persName>MADISON’s</persName>. They com-
        			<lb break="no"/>plimented her to enter first; which she 
        			<lb/>durst not refuse. They followed; and 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>advancing nearly to the centre, fell on 
        			<lb/>their faces; and whilst the cave echoed with 
        			<lb/>their frightful yells and actions, our Ad-
        			<lb break="no"/>ventress, as usual, doubtless, though of 
        			<lb/>home. When they rose, they ran to the 
        			<lb/>further part, dragged three dead Indians 
        			<lb/>out of the cave and laid their faces to the 
        			<lb/>ground. Then climbing a rock, they roll-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed down immense stones; then whooping, 
        			<lb/>first pointing to the sky, then to the stones, 
        			<lb/>and then to the Indians; who were killed 
        			<lb/>by the lightning the preceding day. Having 
        			<lb/>convinced them, she understood it, and that 
        			<lb/>the mate to a dog with her had shared the 
        			<lb/>same fate, they conducted her to her com-
        			<lb break="no"/>pany. They told her, they had despaired 
        			<lb/>of ever seeing her again; concluding her 
        			<lb/>scalp was taken off, when they heard the 
        			<lb/>shouting. She jocosely extolled them 
        			<lb/>for their champion courage, but not for 
        			<lb/>their lenity; as they did not go to her re-
        			<lb break="no"/>lief. They all then went to the cave 
        			<lb/>and attended their savage, funeral cere-
        			<lb break="no"/>monies. 
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE Indians went with them up the river, 
        			<lb/>which they concluded to be one of the 
        		    <lb/><seg xml:id="a118" corresp="#n118"><placeName>Kanhawas</placeName>.</seg><note xml:id="n118" corresp="#a118"><term style="font-style: italic"><placeName>Kanhawas</placeName></term>: or <placeName>Kanawhas</placeName>, a series of interconnected rivers in the region of present-day <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, <placeName>West Virginia</placeName>, and <placeName>Virginia</placeName>.</note> But in this they were mista-
        			<lb break="no"/>ken; they being too much to the South. 
        			<lb/>They hired one of the tribe to pilot them 
        			<lb/>over the <placeName>Allegany</placeName>. Passing the <placeName>Jumette 
        				<lb/>Creek</placeName> and the Fork of <placeName>the Pennsylvania</placeName> 
        			<lb/>and <placeName>Glade Roads</placeName>, about 40 miles from the 
        			<lb/><placeName>Jumetta</placeName>, they came to the foot of the <placeName>Dry 
        				<lb/>Ridge</placeName>. Here they found trees, whose 
        			<lb/>fruit resembled the nectarine; and, like it, 
        			<lb/>delicious to the taste. Eating freely of it, 
        			<lb/>and observing the Indian did not, they de-
        			<lb break="no"/>sisted. And happily so; for it came near 
        			<lb/>proving mortal. Its first effect was sick-
        			<lb break="no"/>ness at the stomach. The descendent of 
        			<lb/>her, who is accused of having been too 
        			<lb/>heedless of the bewitching charm of curios-
        			<lb break="no"/>ity, puked and bled at the nose, till she was 
        			<lb/>unable to walk. The Indian was missing; 
        			<lb/>but soon came with a handful of roots, 
        			<lb/>which, being bruised and applied to her 
        			<lb/>nose and each side of her neck, stopped the 
        			<lb/>blood and sickness.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			HENCE they visited a tribe near a place, 
        			<lb/>called <placeName>Medskar</placeName>. She was here so indispos-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed, she could not proceed on the journey. 
        			<lb/>Her illness proved a relapse of her fever. 
        			<lb/>The pilot interceded with the King for her 
        			<lb/>to tarry with them till the return of her 
        			<lb/>company; which, he said, would be at the 
        			<lb/>close of one moon. Being convinced they 
        			<lb/>were no spies, nor invaders, he consented. 
        			<lb/>He then ordered an Indian and his squaw 
        			<lb/>to doctor her; telling them, the boy would 
        			<lb/>eat good, when fattened.—She remarks 
        			<lb/>that their medicines always had a more sen-
        			<lb break="no"/>sible effect, than those of common physi-
        			<lb break="no"/>cians. Thus, in a short time, she recovered. 
        			<lb/>But I shall not attempt to recount all her 
        			<lb/>sufferings, especially by hunger, but a more 
        			<lb/>intense torture of mind, during this barba-
        			<lb break="no"/>rous servitude.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			HER aim was, never to discover the least 
        			<lb/>cowardice, but always to laugh at their threats. 
        			<lb/>A striking instance of this she exemplifi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed at their coronation of a new King. Her 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>master, like a hell-hound, hooting her into 
        			<lb/>the square, where were many kettles of 
        			<lb/>water boiling, told her, he was going to 
        			<lb/>have a slice of her for dinner. Being the 
        			<lb/>only white man (a <emph style="font-style: italic">girl</emph>!) among them, she 
        			<lb/>was instantly surrounded by the infernals. 
        			<lb/>She asked him if he ever ate Englishmen? 
        			<lb/>He answered, <term style="font-style: italic">good omskuock!</term>  She then told 
        			<lb/>him, he must keep her better, or she should 
        			<lb/>never do to eat. Some understood her; 
        			<lb/>and giving a terrible shout, first told her 
        			<lb/>to cut a notch in the great stone <choice><sic>kalendar</sic><corr>calen-
        				<lb break="no"/>dar</corr></choice>, then putting her hands on the king’s 
        			<lb/>head, she joined the dance, and fared with 
        			<lb/>the rest. Ladies at a civilized ball may be 
        			<lb/>insensible of this scene.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE reader keeps in view, I suppose, 
        			<lb/>that all <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph> courage is not jeoparded in 
        			<lb/>this manner. I am perfectly enraptured with

        			AURORA had scarcely purpled 
        			<lb/>the East after the coronation, before a large 
        			<lb/>company, including our Adventress, sat out 
        			<lb/>for hunting. She quickly espied a wild 
        			<lb/>turkey on a high tree, which she killed. 
        			<lb/>Then, with actions peculiar to Indians, they 
        			<lb/>surrounded her to extol her being quick 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>sighted and a good marksman. They en-
        			<lb break="no"/>camped that night under an hickory; 
        			<lb/>through which was a chasm cut sufficient 
        			<lb/>for two to walk abreast. In the morning 
        			<lb/>they divided into parties. An old Indian, 
        			<lb/>a boy and our Adventress composed one. 
        			<lb/>Elate with the beauty of the morning, the 
        			<lb/>old Indian led off about the sun’s rising. 
        			<lb/>Ascending a large hill, the dogs started a 
        			<lb/>buffalo, which she shot before the Indian 
        			<lb/>got sight. The boy was much elevated 
        			<lb/>with her alertness: but the Indian discov-
        			<lb break="no"/>ered much envy. He however craved 
        			<lb/>the butchering; which she granted, reserv-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing the skin to herself. Making a hearty meal 
        			<lb/>of the buffalo, they travelled all day, with-
        			<lb break="no"/>out killing any more game, except three 
        			<lb/>turkeys.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			NIGHT having again drawn her sable 
        			<lb/>curtains, they took lodgings under a large 
        			<lb/>sycamore: but she had an unsual aver-
        			<lb break="no"/>sion to sleep; as she mistrusted the same of 
        			<lb/>the Indian. At length, she became satis-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>fied he had a fatal design on her life. Feign-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing herself asleep, she waited till he had 
        			<lb/>crawled within musket reach of her; when, 
        			<lb/>to her surprise, she discovered a hatchet in 
        			<lb/>his hand. Without hesitating, she leaped 
        			<lb/>upon her feet, and shot him through the 
        			<lb/>breast, before he had time to beg quarters.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE explosion of the gun awaked the 
        			<lb/>boy; who, seeing his countryman dead, 
        			<lb/>rent his clothes, whooped and tore the 
        			<lb/>ground, like a mad bull; fearing he should 
        			<lb/>share the same fate. She pacified him, by 
        			<lb/>observing, it was in defence of her own life 
        			<lb/>she had killed him; and that, if he would 
        			<lb/>conduct well, and promise on his life to 
        			<lb/>conceal it from his countrymen, he should 
        			<lb/>fare well. He swore allegiance. And in 
        			<lb/>the morning, they hoisted an old log and 
        			<lb/>left the barbarian under it.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			BEHOLD now a young <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph>, who might, 
        			<lb/>doubtless, have shown conspicuous with 
        			<lb/>others of her sex in their domestic sphere, 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>reduced to the forlorn necessity of roam-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing in a desolate wilderness; whose only 
        			<lb/>companion, except wild beasts, is an In-
        			<lb break="no"/>dian boy; whose only sustenance such as 
        		    <lb/>an uncultivated <seg xml:id="a120" corresp="#n120">glebe</seg><note xml:id="n120" corresp="#a120"><term style="font-style: italic">Glebe</term>: plot of land.</note> affords; and whose 
        			<lb/>awful prospect, that of perishing at so great 
        			<lb/>a distance from all succors of humanity! 
        			<lb/>To those, who maintain the doctrines of 
        			<lb/>fatalism, she is certainly a subject of their 
        			<lb/>greatest sympathy. And even to those, who 
        			<lb/>may be unwilling to adduce any other traits 
        			<lb/>in her life, but wild, dissolute freaks of fancy, 
        			<lb/>to be gratified at her option, she is rather 
        			<lb/>an object of pity than contempt.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			AT night, almost spent with hunger and 
        			<lb/>fatigue, they lay down to repose. But they 
        			<lb/>were immediately alarmed by voracious 
        			<lb/>beasts of prey. Their only safety, and that 
        			<lb/>not sure, was to lodge themselves in a high 
        			<lb/>tree. The fires they had kindled gained 
        			<lb/>their approach and encreased their howl-
        			<lb break="no"/>ings. The boy was so frightened, he ran up 
        			<lb/>the tree like a squirrel. She followed, as-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>sisted, doubtless, by the same thing. Though 
        			<lb/>drowsy, they durst not sleep, lest they should 
        			<lb/>fall. With the strap of her fusee and 
        			<lb/>handkerchief, she made herself fast to a limb 
        			<lb/>and slept till day. It rained by showers the 
        			<lb/>most of the night. After she awoke, her 
        			<lb/>second thought was of the boy. She spoke 
        			<lb/>to him; but he did not answer. Looking 
        			<lb/>up at him, she was surprised to see him in-
        			<lb break="no"/>tently employed in disengaging his hair, 
        			<lb/>which he had faithfully twined round the 
        			<lb/>branches.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			AFTER descending the tree and threshing 
        			<lb/>themselves till they could walk, they shap-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed their course for the East; but GOD on-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly knows which way they went. Towards 
        			<lb/>night, they discovered a huge precipice; 
        			<lb/>but found it inaccessible till they had tra-
        			<lb break="no"/>velled nearly four miles round it. Then 
        			<lb/>ascending, they came to a rivulet of good 
        			<lb/>water; and by it, took their abode during 
        			<lb/>the night. In the morning, they were at a 
        			<lb/>stand, whether to descend, or attempt to 
        			<lb/>reach its summit. The poor boy wept bit-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>terly; which, she says, were the first tears 
        			<lb/>she ever saw an Indian shed. They conclud-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed on the latter; as their ascent might pos-
        			<lb break="no"/>sibly discover some prospect of escape. 
        			<lb/>Passing many sharp ledges, they came to a 
        		    <lb/>spot of <seg xml:id="a121" corresp="#n121"><emph style="font-style: italic">bear’s grass</emph>,</seg><note xml:id="n121" corresp="#a121"><term style="font-style: italic">Bear’s grass</term>: a tall North American flowering grass.</note> on which she reclined, 
        			<lb/>thinking the period of her life was hasten-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing with great rapidity, the following may 
        			<lb/>not be a rude sketch of her reflections on 
        			<lb/>this occasion:
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			“WHERE am I! What have I been do-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing! Why did I leave my native land, to 
        			<lb/>grieve the breast of a parent, who has, 
        			<lb/>doubtless shed floods of tears in my ab-
        			<lb break="no"/>sence, and whose cup of calamities seem-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed before but too full! But here I <choice><sic>am;</sic><corr>am,</corr></choice> 
        			<lb/>where I think, human feet never before 
        			<lb/>trod. And though I have relatives, and 
        			<lb/>perhaps, friends, they can obtain no 
        			<lb/>knowledge of me, not even to close my 
        			<lb/>eyes, when death shall have done its office, 
        			<lb/>nor to perform the last, sad demand of na-
        			<lb break="no"/>ture, which is to consign the body to the 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>dust!—But stop! vain imagination! There 
        			<lb/>is a DEITY, from whom I cannot be hidden. 
        			<lb/>It is HE. who shapes my end.—My soul 
        			<lb/>what thinkest thou of immortality, of the 
        			<lb/>world, into which thou art so rapidly hast-
        			<lb break="no"/>ening! No words, no sagacity can disclose 
        			<lb/>my apprehensions. Every doubt wears 
        			<lb/>the aspect of horror; and would certain-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly overwhelm me, were it not for a few 
        			<lb/>gleams of hope which dart across the tre-
        			<lb break="no"/>mendous gloom. Happy, methinks I should 
        			<lb/>be, could I but utter even to myself, the 
        			<lb/>anguish of my mind, thus suspended be-
        			<lb break="no"/>tween the extremes of infinite joy, or eter-
        			<lb break="no"/>nal misery! It appears I have but just now 
        			<lb/>emerged from sleep! Oh, how have I em-
        			<lb break="no"/>ployed my time! In what delirium has the 
        			<lb/>thread of my life, thus far, been spun! 
        			<lb/>While the planets in their courses, the sun 
        			<lb/>and stars in their spheres have lent their 
        			<lb/>refulgent beams—perhaps I have been 
        			<lb/>lighted only to perdition!”
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			WHILE in this extacy, she availed herself 
        			<lb/>of the opportunity to write to her female 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>companion; and in it inclosed a letter to 
        			<lb/>her mother, in hopes it might, by means of 
        			<lb/>the boy, reach her.

        					WHILE in this position, she heard the 
        					<lb/>report of a gun. Starting about, she 
        					<lb/>missed the boy and her fusee. She could 
        					<lb/>not recollect whether he was with her when 
        					<lb/>she sat down, or not. But summoning all 
        					<lb/>her strength and resolution, she had nearly 
        					<lb/>reached the summit of the mountain, when 
        					<lb/>she met the boy. He told her he fired that 
        					<pb/>
        					<lb/>she might come to him; but as she did 
        					<lb/>not, he concluded she would do to eat, 
        					<lb/>and was going to fill his belly with good 
        					<lb/><term style="font-style: italic">omskuock</term>.  He seemed glad he had found 
        					<lb/>something to relieve them. Giving her a 
        					<lb/>scrohon and four grapes, he bid her follow 
        					<lb/>him. Coming to an immense rock, he 
        					<lb/>crept through a fissure; and with much 
        					<lb/>ado, she after him. Here they found wild 
        					<lb/>scrohons, hops, gourds, ground-nuts and 
        					<lb/>beans. Though mostly rotten, they ate 
        					<lb/>some of them, and were revived. Then, 
        					<lb/>at a great distance, opened to their view, a 
        					<lb/>large river or lake, and vastly high moun-
        					<lb break="no"/>tains. Whilst they were contriving how 
        					<lb/>to get to the river, they heard the firing 
        					<lb/>of small arms, which they answered and 
        					<lb/>had returns. 
        				</p>
        		<p>
        			DESCENDING the precipice, they came to 
        		    <lb/>large rocks of <seg xml:id="a122" corresp="#n122">isinglass,</seg><note xml:id="n122" corresp="#a122"><term style="font-style: italic">Isinglass</term>: the mineral mica.</note> and brooks of choice 
        			<lb/>water. At its base they came up with a 
        			<lb/>large company of Indians, who had been to 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/><placeName>Detroit</placeName> to draw blankets and military stores. 
        			<lb/>But to her surprise, who should make one 
        			<lb/>of the company, but a dejected young <emph style="font-style: italic">fe-
        				<lb break="no"/>male!</emph> At once, she was anxious to learn 
        			<lb/>her history; which she soon did at private 
        			<lb/>interviews.—She said she was taken from 
        			<lb/><placeName>Cherry Valley</placeName>—had been sold many times, 
        			<lb/>but expected to be sold no more!—Tears 
        			<lb/>prevented her proceeding.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			IN three days they arrived at the place 
        			<lb/>from whence she first sat out on hunting. 
        			<lb/>The old chief accused her for having run 
        			<lb/>away after the Englishmen: and it was the 
        			<lb/>boy, with the interposition of Providence, 
        			<lb/>saved her life. She here quickly learned, 
        			<lb/>that her unfortunate <emph style="font-style: italic">sister sufferer</emph> was to be 
        			<lb/>burnt, after they should have one court 
        		    <lb/>and a <seg xml:id="a123" corresp="#n123"><term style="font-style: italic">pawaw</term>, for letting fall a <term style="font-style: italic">papoos</term>,</seg><note xml:id="n123" corresp="#a123"><term style="font-style: italic">Pawaw</term>: likely a variation of powwow, a term for a Native American meeting; <term style="font-style: italic">Papoos</term>: a term for a Native American baby. Both of these terms are Algonquian in origin and were increasingly applied to Native Americans of different linguistic backgrounds.</note> when 
        				<lb/>travelling with an intense load. At once she 
        			<lb/>resolved to liberate her, if any thing short 
        			<lb/>of her own life would do it. Her plan was 
        			<lb/>thus concerted: She requested to marry 
        			<lb/>one of their girls. They haughtily refused; 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>but concluded, for so much, she might 
        			<lb/>have the white girl. Begging her reprieve, 
        			<lb/>till the return of her company, which hap-
        			<lb break="no"/>pened the next day, they all liberally con-
        			<lb break="no"/>tributed, and thus paid her ransom. The 
        			<lb/>poor girl fainted at the news. But hearing 
        			<lb/>the conditions, she seemed suspended in 
        			<lb/>choice, whether to suffer an ignominious 
        			<lb/>death, or be bought as a booty to be ravish-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed of her virgin purity:—For she inti-
        			<lb break="no"/>mated that, among all the cruelties of these 
        			<lb/>savages, they had never intruded on her 
        			<lb/>chastity. Her intended husband privately 
        			<lb/>told her, the rites of the marriage bed should 
        			<lb/>be deferred, till the ceremony should be 
        			<lb/>solemnized in the land of civilization. At 
        			<lb/>night a bear’s skin was spread for their lodg-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing; but, like a timorous bride, sleep was 
        			<lb/>to her a stranger. On their return to <placeName>Phil-
        				<lb break="no"/>adelphia</placeName>, they purchased her a suit of 
        			<lb/>clothes; but she, unable to express her 
        			<lb/>gratitude, received them on her knees, and 
        			<lb/>was, doubtless, glad to relinquish her sham 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>marriage, and to be sent to her uncle; who 
        			<lb/>she said, lived in <placeName>James City</placeName>.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ARRIVED at <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, she repaired to 
        			<lb/>visit her companion, who became much af-
        			<lb break="no"/>fected with her history. She now thought 
        			<lb/>it time to divert herself of the mask; at 
        			<lb/>least to divert a passion, which she feared 
        			<lb/>had too much involved one of the choicest 
        			<lb/>of her sex. After thanking her for her 
        			<lb/>generous esteem, and many evasive 
        			<lb/>apologies—that she was but a stripling sol-
        			<lb break="no"/>dier, and that had she inclinations, indi-
        			<lb break="no"/>gence would forbid her settling in the world: 
        			<lb/>The beautiful nymph replied, that, sooner 
        			<lb/>than a concession should take place with the 
        			<lb/>least reluctance, she would forfeit every 
        			<lb/>enjoyment of connubial bliss: But, she 
        			<lb/>added, if want of interest was the only ob-
        			<lb break="no"/>stacle, she was quickly to come into the 
        			<lb/>possession of an ample fortune; and finally 
        			<lb/>intimated her desire, that she should not 
        			<lb/>leave her. 
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			TOUCHED with such a pathetic assem-
        			<lb break="no"/>blage of love and beauty, she burst into 
        			<lb/>tears, and told her, she would go to the 
        			<lb/>northward, settle her affairs, and in the en-
        			<lb break="no"/>suing spring, if health should permit, would 
        			<lb/>return; when, if her person could conduce 
        			<lb/>to her happiness, she should be richly en-
        		    <lb break="no"/>titled to <seg xml:id="a124" corresp="#n124">it.</seg><note xml:id="n124" corresp="#a124">SHE has since declared, she meant to have executed this resolution, had not some traits of her life been published in the intervening time; and that this lady should have been the first to disclose her sex. Before they parted, she made her a present of six holland shirts, twenty five guineas and an elegant silver watch. This she will not blush to own, if alive; as it was out of the purest regard for her own sex. [Note in the original.]</note> Thus parted two lovers, more

        		<p>
        			THIS event, as it is unnatural, may be 
        			<lb/>disputed. It is also rare, that the same pas-
        			<lb break="no"/>sion should ever have brought a woman to 
        			<lb/>bed with seven children at a birth: And I 
        			<lb/>think <emph style="font-style: italic">eight</emph> would rather be miraculous than 
        			<lb/>natural. But it is said, that though per-

        			<lb/>that this is a fact that will admit of incon-
        			<pb/>
        			<lb break="no"/>testible evidence. Nor need females think 
        			<lb/>themselves piqued to acknowledge it; as 
        			<lb/>no one denies, she was not an agreeable ob-
        			<lb break="no"/>ject when masqueraded; which, by the by, 
        			<lb/>I am sorry to say, is too often mistaken by 
        			<lb/>that sex.

        		<p>
        			THUS, we have a remarkable instance of 
        			<lb/>the origin of that species of love, which 
        			<lb/>renders the enjoyment of life satisfactory, 
        			<lb/>and consummates the bliss of immortality. 
        			<lb/>The passion entertained by the sexes to-
        			<lb break="no"/>wards each other is, doubtless, from this 
        			<lb/>source; and will always be laudable, when 
        			<lb/>managed with prudence. But I appeal to 
        			<lb/>the lady’s own bosom, if, after discovering 
        			<lb/>her <emph style="font-style: italic">sister</emph>, her passion had not subsided into

        			ELATED with her transition from 
        			<lb/>a savage wilderness, to a land smiling with 
        			<lb/>agriculture and civilization, her mind was 
        			<lb/>once more illuminated with agreeable pros-
        			<lb break="no"/>pects. But a review of her situation cast an 
        			<lb/>unfriendly group of objects in her way. 
        			<lb/>A remembrance of the Doctor’s queries and 
        			<lb/>injunctions, was but recognizing the necessi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ty of a garland of fig leaves to screen a pearl, 
        			<lb/>that could glitter only without disguise.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ON the day of her departure from <placeName>Phil-
        				<lb break="no"/>adelphia</placeName>, he entrusted her with the care 
        			<lb/>of a letter to <persName>Gen. PATTERSON</persName>, then at 
        			<lb/><placeName>West Point</placeName>. Then taking an affectionate 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>farewell of his family, she sat out for the 
        			<lb/>place. She went in the stage to <placeName>Elizabeth 
        				<lb/>Town</placeName>, 15 miles from <placeName>New York</placeName>. The 
        			<lb/>stage boats being gone over, she, with 
        			<lb/>about twelve others went on board the on-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly one remaining. The skipper was reluc-
        			<lb break="no"/>tant to accompany them; as it was late, 
        			<lb/>rainy and a strong wind ahead.—They quick-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly found the storm increased; and they had 
        			<lb/>not gone half their voyage, before they had 
        			<lb/>the terrible prospect of the foundering of 
        			<lb/>a boat with nineteen passengers from <placeName>South 
        				<lb/>Amboy</placeName>, bound to <placeName>New York</placeName>. Every one 
        			<lb/>was lost. They heard their piteous cries, as 
        			<lb/>the surges were closing over their heads; but 
        			<lb/>could afford no relief. Nor was their own 
        			<lb/>prospect much better. It was asked, whether 
        			<lb/>it was possible to swim to <placeName>Staten Island</placeName>? 
        			<lb/>It was unanimously negatived: but a few 
        			<lb/>minutes put them to the desperate experi-
        			<lb break="no"/>ment. Being nearly in the centre of the 
        			<lb/>channel, the current rapid, and the storm 
        			<lb/>boisterous, the boat filled with water and 
        			<lb/>sunk under them. Though nothing but 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>death now stared them in the face; yet 
        			<lb/>those exertions, which had before snatched 
        			<lb/>her from his jaws, we may suppose, were 
        			<lb/>not here unemployed. She had on a large 
        			<lb/>coat, which served to buoy her above the 
        			<lb/>water; though she was often ingulphed in 
        			<lb/>the surges. She was washed back twice, 
        			<lb/>after reaching the soft sands. But, fortu-
        			<lb break="no"/>nately, clasping her arms on a bed of rushes, 
        			<lb/>she held till many waves had spent their fury 
        			<lb/>over her. Thus recruiting strength, and 
        			<lb/>taking the advantage of the waves, she gain-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed hard bottom and the shore. 
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			ON the shore, she found others in the 
        			<lb/>same wretched situation, unable to stand. 
        			<lb/>She lay on her face all night. In the morn-
        			<lb break="no"/>ing, the storm having abated, she heard <persName>Dr. 
        				<lb/>VICKENS</persName> say, “Blessed be GOD, it is day<choice><sic>;</sic><corr>,</corr></choice> 
        			<lb/>though I believe I am the only survivor 
        			<lb/>among you all!” Happily, they were all 
        			<lb/>alive, except two; who unfortunately 
        			<lb/>found a tomb in the watery element. They 
        			<lb/>were soon taken up by a boat cruising for 
        			<lb/>that purpose, and carried back to <placeName>Eliza-
        				<pb/>
        				<lb break="no"/>beth Town</placeName>. Most of her equipments, a 
        			<lb/>trunk, including her journal, money, &amp;c. 
        		    <lb/>was lost. Her watch and a <seg xml:id="a125" corresp="#n125"><placeName>morocco</placeName> pock-
        		        <lb break="no"/>et-book,</seg><note xml:id="n125" corresp="#a125"><term style="font-style: italic"><placeName>Morocco</placeName> pocket-book</term>: <placeName>Morocco</placeName> leather was a generic term for goat or sheep leather tanned with methods developed in <placeName>Morocco</placeName>—here the emphasis may be on a more or less waterproof leather envelop for carrying documents.</note> containing the letter, were saved.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			THE third day, she had a good passage to 
        			<lb/><placeName>New York</placeName>; from thence to <placeName>West Point</placeName>. 
        			<lb/>Arrived at the General’s quarters she seem-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed like one sent from the dead; as they 
        			<lb/><choice><orig>had concluded</orig><reg>concluded</reg></choice> the <placeName>Potter’s Field</placeName> had long 
        			<lb/>been her home. Her next business was, to 
        			<lb/>deliver the letter. Cruel task! Dreading 
        			<lb/>the contents, she delayed it some days. At 
        			<lb/>length, she resolved, her fidelity should tri-
        			<lb break="no"/>umph over every perturbation of mind in 
        			<lb/>the delivery of the letter, and to apologize 
        			<lb/>for her non-trust. Accordingly, finding 
        			<lb/>him alone, she gave him the quivering trea-
        		    <lb break="no"/>sure, made <seg xml:id="a126" corresp="#n126">obeisance,</seg><note xml:id="n126" corresp="#a126"><term style="font-style: italic">Obeisance</term>: obedience or submission.</note> turned upon her <choice><sic>heal</sic><corr>heel</corr></choice> 
        			<lb/>and withdrew in haste. 
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			PRECISELY an hour after, unattended, he 
        			<lb/>sent for her to his apartment. She says—
        			<lb/>“<hi rend="italic">A re-entrance was harder than facing a can-
        				<lb break="no"/>nonade</hi>.” Being desired to seat herself, the 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>General, calling her by name, thus grace-
        			<lb break="no"/>fully addressed her:—“Since you have 
        			<lb/>continued near three years in my service, 
        			<lb/>always vigilant, vivacious, faithful, and, in 
        			<lb/>many respects, distinguished yourself from 
        			<lb/>your fellows.—I would only ask—Does 
        			<lb/>that <emph style="font-style: italic">martial attire</emph>, which now glitters on 
        			<lb/>your body, conceal a <emph style="font-style: italic">female’s form!</emph>” The 
        			<lb/>close of the sentence drew tears in his eyes, 
        			<lb/>and she fainted. He used his efforts to re-
        			<lb break="no"/>cover her; which he effected. But an aspect 
        			<lb/>of wildness was blended in her countenance. 
        			<lb/>She prostrated herself at his feet, and beg-
        			<lb break="no"/>ged her life! He shook his head; but she 
        			<lb/>remembers not his reply. Bidding her rise, 
        			<lb/>he gave her the letter, which he continued 
        			<lb/>to hold in his hand. Reason having resum-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed its empire, she read it with emotions. It 
        			<lb/>was interesting, pathetic and colored with 
        			<lb/>the pencil of humanity. He again exclaim-
        			<lb break="no"/>ed—“<emph style="font-style: italic">Can it be so!</emph>” Her heart could no 
        			<lb/>longer harbor deception. Banishing all 
        			<lb/>subterfuge, with as much resolution, as 
        			<lb/>possible, she confessed herself—<emph style="font-style: italic">a female</emph>.
        		</p>
        		<pb/>
        		<p>
        			HE then enquired concerning her rela-
        			<lb break="no"/>tions; but especially of her primeval in-
        			<lb break="no"/>ducements to occupy the <emph style="font-style: italic">field of war!</emph> She 
        			<lb/>proceeded to give a succinct and true ac-
        			<lb break="no"/>count; and concluded by asking, if her <emph style="font-style: italic">life</emph> 
        			<lb/>would be spared!—He told her, she might 
        			<lb/>not only think herself safe, while under his

        			<lb break="no"/>chievements deserved ample compensation
        			<lb/>—that he would quickly obtain her dis-
        			<lb break="no"/>charge, and she should be safely conducted 
        			<lb/>to her friends.—But having had the tuition 
        			<lb/>of her as a <emph style="font-style: italic">soldier</emph>, he said, he must take lib-
        			<lb break="no"/>erty to give her that advice, which he hoped 
        			<lb/>would ornament the functions of her life, 
        			<lb/>when the masculine garb should be laid a-
        			<lb break="no"/>side and she taken to the embraces of that 
        			<lb/>sex she was then personating.

        		<p>
        			IMMEDIATELY she had an apartment as-

        			<lb break="no"/>conciled to the fact, till it was corroborated 
        			<pb/>
        			<lb/>by her own words. She requested, as a 
        			<lb/>pledge of her virtue, that strict enquiry 
        			<lb/>should be made of those, with whom she 
        			<lb/>had been mess-mate. This was according-
        			<lb break="no"/>ly done. And the effect was—a panic of 
        			<lb/>surprise with every soldier. Groups of 
        			<lb/>them now crowded to behold a phenome-
        			<lb break="no"/>non, which before appeared a natural object. 
        			<lb/>But as access was inadmissible, many turned 
        			<lb/>infidels, and few had faith.—Her discharge 
        			<lb/>is from <persName>Gen. KNOX</persName>; her recommendations

        		<p>
        			BEING informed, her effects and diplo-

        			<lb break="no"/>litest respects to the gentlemen, who accom-

        			THUS she made her exit from the tragic 
        			<lb/>stage. But how requisite was a parent’s

        			<lb break="no"/>olution of her sex! With what eager steps, 
        			<lb/>would she have bent her next course over 
        			<lb/>the then congealed glebe—to give a parent 
        			<lb/>the agreeable surprise of beholding her long 
        			<lb/>lost child—to implore her forgiveness of so 
        			<lb/>wide a breach of duty, and to assume a 
        			<lb/>course of life, which only could be an or-
        			<lb break="no"/>nament to her sex and extenuation of her

        			<lb break="no"/>ed this. But being deprived of these bles-

        			<lb break="no"/>tered hamlet in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>; where she

        			<lb break="no"/>ter as a man of the world, and was not awk-
        			<lb break="no"/>ward in the common business of a farmer.  
        			<lb/>But, if I remember, she has intimated—that 
        			<lb/>nothing in the villa could have better occu-

        			BUT her correspondence with her sister 
        			<lb/>sex!—Surely it must have been that of sen-
        			<lb break="no"/>timent, taste, purity; as animal love, on her 
        			<lb/>part, was out of the question. But I beg ex-
        			<lb break="no"/>cuse, if I happen not to specify every par-
        			<lb break="no"/>ticular of this agreeable round of acquaint-
        			<lb break="no"/>ance. It may suffice, merely, to say, her 
        			<lb/>uncle being a compassionate man, often re-
        			<lb break="no"/>prehended her for her freedom with the 
        			<lb/>girls of his villa; and them he plumply cal-

        		<p>
        			TO be plain, I am an enemy to intrigues 
        			<lb/>of all kinds. Our female adept had money; 
        			<lb/>and at the worst could have purchased 
        			<lb/>friends of our sex: But, methinks, those 
        			<lb/>who can claim the least pretension to fem-
        			<lb break="no"/>inine delicacy, must be won only, by the

        		<p>
        			AFTER deliniating the life of a per-
        			<lb break="no"/>son, it seems natural to recapitulate, in a clo-
        		    <lb break="no"/>ser assemblage, the leading features of his cha-
        		    <lb break="no"/>racter. 
        		    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        PERHAPS, a spirit of enterprize, persever-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ance and competition was never more distin-
        	        <lb break="no"/>guishable in a female, than in <persName>Miss SAMP-
        	            <lb break="no"/>SON</persName>. And whilst we are surprised that she left 
        	        <lb/>her own tranquil sphere for the most perilous
        	        <lb/>—the field of <emph style="font-style: italic">war</emph>, we must acknowledge, it is, 
        	        <lb/>at least, a circumstantial link in the chain of 
        	        <lb/>our illustrious revolution. She never would 
        	        <lb/>accept a promotion while in the army; though 
        	        <lb/>it is said, she was urged to take a Lieutenant’s 
        	        <lb/>commission.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        I WILL here give an instance of her dread of 
        	        <lb/>rivalship. It was soon after she inlisted.—
        	        <lb/>Having been reluctantly drawn into a ring of 
        	        <lb/>wrestling, she was worsted; though it is said, 
        	        <lb/>she flung a number. But the idea of a com-
        	        <lb break="no"/>petitor deprived her of sleep the whole night. 
        	        <lb/>Let this be a memento to <persName>Columbia’s</persName> daugh-
        	        <pb/>
        	        <lb break="no"/>ters; that they may beware of too violent 
        	        <lb/>scuffles with our sex. We are athletic, haugh-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ty and unconquerable. Besides, your dislo-
        	        <lb break="no"/>cated limbs are a piteous sight!—And it seems 
        	        <lb/>this was a warning to her: For it was noted by 
        	        <lb/>the soldiers, that she never wrestled, nor suf-
        	        <lb break="no"/>fered any one to twine his arms about her 
        	        <lb/>shoulders; as was their custom when walking.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        AND lest her courage has not been sufficient-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ly demonstrated, I will <seg xml:id="a137" corresp="#n137">adduce</seg><note xml:id="n137" corresp="#a137"><term style="font-style: italic">Adduce</term>: cite.</note> one more in-

        	        <lb/>she was sent from <placeName>West Point</placeName>, on business, to

        	        <lb/>of Santee. She rode <persName>Capt. PHELON’s</persName> horse. 
        	        <lb/>On her return, just at the close of twilight, she 
        	        <lb/>was surprised by two ruffians, who rushed hast-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ily from a thicket, seized her horse’s bridle, 
        	        <lb/>and demanded her money, or her life. She 
        	        <lb/>was armed with a brace of pistols and a hang-
        	        <lb break="no"/>er. Looking at the one, who held the horse, 
        	        <lb/>she said, “<emph style="font-style: italic"><persName>F. B——</persName>, I think I know you; and 
        	            <lb/>this moment you become a dead man, if you persist in 
        	            <lb/>your demand!</emph>” Hearing a pistol cock at the 
        	        <lb/>same time, his compeer fled; and he begged 
        	        <lb/><choice><sic>quarters</sic><corr>quarter</corr></choice> and forgiveness; which she granted,

        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        IT is, perhaps, sufficiently authenticated,

        	        <lb/>them—as vices, to be guarded against. I 
        	        <lb/>have only to desire this class of my readers to 
        	        <lb/>think as favorable as possible of our sex; but, 
        	        <lb/>on all accounts, to cherish the lovely fugitive
        	        <lb/>—<emph style="font-style: italic">virtue</emph>, in their own. For, too much suspi-
        	        <lb break="no"/>cion of another’s, argues, too strongly, a want 
        	        <lb/>of the same charming ornament in themselves; 
        	        <lb/>unless they are old maids, or bachelors.

        	        I SHALL here make a small digression.—As 
        	        <lb/>our Heroine was walking the streets in <placeName>Phila-
        	            <lb break="no"/>delphia</placeName>, in a beautiful, serene evening, she 
        	        <lb/>was ravished by the sweet, pensive notes of a 
        	        <lb/><term style="font-style: italic">piano-forté</term>. Looking up at a third loft she 
        	        <lb/>discovered a young female, who seemed eve-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ry way expressive of the music she made. She 
        	        <lb/>often after listened to the same sounds; and 
        	        <lb/>was as often surprised, that a sigh should be 
        	        <lb/>blended with such exquisite harmony and 
        	        <lb/>beauty.—Of this female, I will transmit to my 
        	        <lb/>readers the following pathetic history.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        <persName>FATIMA</persName> was the eldest of three daughters; 
        	        <lb/>whose parents had acquired an ample fortune, 
        	        <lb/>and resided in a part of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, 
        	        <lb/>where nature sheds her blessings in profuse 
        	        <lb/>abundance. But, unhappily, their conduct to-
        	        <lb break="no"/>wards them was distinguished, like that of o-
        	        <lb break="no"/>thers, whose fondness so infinitely exceed 
        	        <lb/>their prudence. They were not, however, 
        	        <lb/>deficient in many external accomplishments. 
        	        <lb/>Early was <persName>FATIMA</persName> taught to speak prettily, 
        	        <pb/>
        	        <lb/>rather than properly; to admire what is bril-
        	        <lb break="no"/>liant, instead of what is solid; to study dress 
        	        <lb/>and pink alamode; to be active at her toilet, 
        	        <lb/>and much there; to dance charmingly at a 
        	        <lb/>ball, or farcical entertainment; to form hasty 
        	        <lb/>and miscellaneous connexions; to show a 
        	        <lb/>beautiful face, and sigh for admiration;—in 
        	        <lb/>short, to be amused, rather than instructed; 
        	        <lb/>but at last—to discover an ill accomplished 
        	        <lb/>mind! This is beauty in a maze. Such oc-
        	        <lb break="no"/>cupations filled up her juvenile years. Her 
        	        <lb/>noblest proficiencies were music, drawing, 
        	        <lb/>&amp;c. but an injudicious choice of books exclu-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ded their influence, if they had any, from her 
        	        <lb/>mind. Thus we may conclude her course of 
        	        <lb/>education led her to set the greatest estimate 
        	        <lb/>on this external new kind of creature; whilst 
        	        <lb/>her internal source—her immortal part, re-
        	        <lb break="no"/>mained, as in a fog, or like a gem in a tube of 
        	        <lb/>adamant.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        NATURE had been lavish in the formation 
        	        <lb/>of <persName>FATIMA</persName>. And on her first appearance, 
        	        <lb/>one must have been strongly impressed in her 
        	        <lb/>favor. But what says the sequel?—The in-
        	        <lb break="no"/>vigorating influence of <persName>Venus</persName> had scarcely 
        	        <lb/>warmed her bosom, when, towards the close 
        	        <lb/>of a beautiful, soft day, in her rural excur-
        	        <lb break="no"/>sion, she first beheld <persName>PHILANDER</persName>; who had 
        	        <lb/>become a gleaner in her father’s fields. A 
        	        <lb/>mutual impulse of passions, till then unfelt, fir-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ed their bosoms: For <persName>PHILANDER</persName> was much 
        	        <lb/>indebted to nature for a polished form; and 
        	        <pb/>
        	        <lb/>something uncommonly attracting in his looks, 
        	        <lb/>seemed to veil the neglect of his mind. Un-
        	        <lb break="no"/>fortunate youth! His parents were poor: and 
        	        <lb/>to add to his misery, they had deprived him of 
        	        <lb/>their only, and yet most important, legacy—
        	        <lb/>I mean, the cultivation of his mind. Had 
        	        <lb/>not this been his lot, he might have made 
        	        <lb/>himself rich and <persName>FATIMA</persName> happy.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        AFTER this, <persName>FATIMA’s</persName> chief delight was—
        	        <lb/>to walk in the fields, to see her father’s flock, 
        	        <lb/>and to listen to the pipe of <persName>PHILANDER</persName>. Re-
        	        <lb break="no"/>peated interviews brought them more ac-
        	        <lb break="no"/>quainted with each other. Each attempted to 
        	        <lb/>steal the lustre of the eye and the crimson 
        	        <lb/>blush; which a too warm constitution could 
        	        <lb/>ill conceal. At length, an unreserved familiar-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ity took place. Both had been taught to <emph style="font-style: italic">love;</emph> 
        	        <lb/>and both had missed <persName>PLATO’s</persName> and <persName></persName> 
        	        <lb/>system, which should have taught them—<emph style="font-style: italic">how</emph>. 
        	        <lb/><persName>FATIMA</persName> durst not let her parents know, that 
        	        <lb/>a peasant possessed her virginal love. She, 
        	        <lb/>therefore, under pretence of regaling herself 
        	        <lb/>in the garden, often reserved the keys, that 
        	        <lb/>secured its avenues: and whilst the dew dis-
        	        <lb break="no"/>tilled its pensive sweets, the sequestered al-
        	        <lb break="no"/>cove, or embowered grass plat, too often wit-
        	        <lb break="no"/>nessed their lambent amours.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        ONE night—a night that must ever remain 
        	        <lb/>horrible to their remembrance, and which 
        	        <lb/>should be obliterated from the annals of time
        	        <lb/>—<persName>FATIMA</persName> sat at the window of her apartment, 
        	        <lb/>to behold, rather than contemplate, the beau-
        	        <pb/>
        	        <lb break="no"/>ties of the evening. The hamlet was at rest, 
        	        <lb/>when she discovered PHILANDER passing in the 
        	        <lb/>street. Her <emph style="font-style: italic">dishabille</emph> too plainly disclosed her 
        	        <lb/>charms, when she hastened with the fatal key 
        	        <lb/>to the garden gate; where <persName>PHILANDER</persName> had 
        	        <lb/>just arrived. The massy door having grated 
        	        <lb/>upon its hinges, they walked a number of 
        	        <lb/>times through the bowling-green, till at length, 
        	        <lb/>almost imperceptibly, they found themselves 
        	        <lb/>at the door, that led to <persName>FATIMA’s</persName> apartment<choice><sic>.—</sic><corr>.</corr></choice>
        	        <lb/>The clock struck twelve, when they tip-toed 
        	        <lb/>through a number of windings, till they arri-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ved at the chamber; which, till then, had been 
        	        <lb/>an asylum for the virginity of <persName>FATIMA</persName>.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        It is needless to paint the scenes, that suc-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ceeded. A taper, she had left burning on her 
        	        <lb/><seg xml:id="a142" corresp="#n142">scrutoire,</seg><note xml:id="n142" corresp="#a142"><term style="font-style: italic">Scrutoire</term>: a writing desk.</note> with the rays of the moon, reflected 
        	        <lb/>a dim light on the rich furniture of the room, 
        	        <lb/>and on the alcove; in which lay, for the last 
        	        <lb/>time, the tranquil <persName>FATIMA</persName>! But this light, 
        	        <lb/>feeble as it was, disclosed to <persName>PHILANDER</persName> a 
        	        <lb/>thousand new charms in the fascinating spec-
        	        <lb break="no"/>tacle of so much love and beauty. Sensuality 
        	        <lb/>took the lead of every reasoning faculty; and 
        	        <lb/>both became instrumental to their own destruc-
        	        <lb break="no"/>tion. <persName>PHILANDER</persName> became a total slave to his 
        	        <lb/>passions. He could no longer revere the 
        	        <lb/>temple of chastity. He longed to erect his 
        	        <lb/>fatal triumph on the ruins of credulous virtue. 
        	        <lb/>He saw nothing but what served to inflame his 
        	        <lb/>passions. His eyes rioted in forbidden de-
        	        <lb break="no"/>lights. And his warm embraces kindled new 
        	        <pb/>
        	        <lb/>fires in the bosom of this beauteous maid.—
        	        <lb/>The night was silent as death: not a zephyr 
        	        <lb/>was heard to rustle in the leaves below—but 
        	        <lb/>HEAVEN was a recording witness to their 
        	        <lb/>criminal pleasures!
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        THE lost <persName>FATIMA</persName> beheld her brutal ravish-
        	        <lb break="no"/>er with horror and distraction. But from 
        	        <lb/>that fatal moment, his enthusiastic love cooled; 
        	        <lb/>and he shunned her private recesses and pub-
        	        <lb break="no"/>lic haunts. <persName>FATIMA</persName>, to avoid the indignation 
        	        <lb/>of her parents, eloped from them.  Her eyes 
        	        <lb/>were opened! Many were her wearisome 
        	        <lb/>steps to find an asylum from that guilt, which, 
        	        <lb/>through her parents neglect, she incurred on 
        	        <lb/>herself. In vain did she lament, that some 
        	        <lb/>piteous cherub had not preserved her to a 
        	        <lb/>more propitious fate—that she had not been 
        	        <lb/>doomed to a cloistered convent, to have made 
        	        <lb/>an eternal vow of celibacy, to have prostrated 
        	        <lb/>herself to wooden statues, to have kissed the 
        	        <lb/>feet of monks and to have pined away her life 
        	        <lb/>in solitude!—Thus, she continues to mourn 
        	        <lb/>the loss of that happiness, she lost through 
        	        <lb/>neglect of education.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        <persName>FATIMA</persName> was in her <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph> attire—our He-
        	        <lb break="no"/>roine was a <emph style="font-style: italic">soldier</emph>. And I should sacrifice 
        	        <lb/>many tender feelings to prefer, to my FAIR 
        	        <lb/>readers—the situation of either!
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        I CONFESS, I might justly be thought a 
        	        <lb/>monster to the female sex, were I willing to 
        	        <lb/>suggest that her original motive was the com-
        	        <lb break="no"/>pany of the venal sycophant, the plotting 
        	        <pb/>
        	        <lb/>knave, the disgusting, ugly debauchee; or 
        	        <lb/>that her turning volunteer in <persName>Columbia’s</persName> cause, 
        	        <lb/>was a meditated plot against her own sex. Oh! 
        	        <lb/>this would be too cruel.—Custom is the dupe 
        	        <lb/>of fancy: nor can we scarcely conceive what 
        	        <lb/>may not be relished, till the fugitive has worn 
        	        <lb/>out every shift. But let us remember, though 
        	        <lb/>it constitutes our esteem and reverence, it 
        	        <lb/>does not, always, our prudence and propriety. 
        	        <lb/>A high cut robe, for instance, though it may 
        	        <lb/>agreeably feast the imagination, may not prove 
        	        <lb/>the most prudent garb for every fair object, 
        	        <lb/>who wears it. But in the asylum of female 
        	        <lb/>protection, may I not be thought their mean-
        	        <lb break="no"/>est votary, should not a humble ejaculation 
        	        <lb/>prevent every robe-wearer from being led

        	    <p>
        	        IT need not be asked, whether a proper un-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ion of the sexes is recommendable and just. 
        	        <lb/>Nature claims this as her primogenial and in-
        	        <lb break="no"/>dissoluble bond: And national custom esta-
        	        <lb break="no"/>blishes the mode. But to mention the inter-
        	        <lb break="no"/>course of our Heroine with her sex, would, 
        	        <lb/>like others more dangerous, require an apol-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ogy I know not how to make. It must be 
        	        <lb/>supposed, she acted more from necessity than 
        	        <lb/>a voluntary impulse of passion; and no doubt, 
        	        <lb/>succeeded beyond her expectations, or desires. 
        	        <lb/>Harmless thing! An useful veteran in war!—
        	        <lb/>An inoffensive companion in love! These 
        	        <pb/>
        	        <lb/>are certainly requisites, if not virtues. They 
        	        <lb/>are always the soldier’s glory; but too seldom 
        	        <lb/>his boast. Had she been capacitated and in-
        	        <lb break="no"/>clined to prey, like a vulture, on the innocence 
        	        <lb/>of her sex; vice might have hurried vice, 
        	        <lb/>and taste have created appetition. Thus, she 
        	        <lb/>would have been less entitled to the clem-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ency of the public. For individual crimes 
        	        <lb/>bring on public nuisances and calamities: 
        	        <lb/>And debauchery is one of the first. But in-
        	        <lb break="no"/>capacity, which seldom begets desire, must ren-
        	        <lb break="no"/>der her, in this respect, unimpeachable.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        REMEMBER, females, I am your advocate; 
        	        <lb/>and, like you, would pay my devoirs to the 
        	        <lb/>Goddess of love. Admit that you conceived 
        	        <lb/>an attachment for a <emph style="font-style: italic">female soldier</emph>. What is the 
        	        <lb/>harm? She acted in the department of that sex, 
        	        <lb/>whose embraces you naturally seek. From 
        	        <lb/>a like circumstance, we are liable to the same 
        	        <lb/>impulse. Love is the ruling dictate of the 
        	        <lb/>soul.—But viewing <persName>VENUS</persName> in all her influen-
        	        <lb break="no"/>tial charms—did she gain too great an ascen-
        	        <lb break="no"/>dancy over that virtue, which should guard the 
        	        <lb/>receptacle of your love? Did the dazzling 
        	        <lb/>enchantress, after fascinating you in her wilds, 
        	        <lb/>inhumanly leave you in a situation—ready to 
        	        <lb/>yield the pride and ornament of your sex—

        	        <persName>COLUMBIA</persName> demands our review.—To stretch

        	        <lb/>the optics of sage <persName>COLUMBUS</persName>, first lighted on 
        	        <lb/>the American shores, and to trace the mazy

        	        <lb/>to the present period, when she stand con-

        	        <lb/>her once stubborn glebe, our encounters with

        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        WE have moulded a constitutional govern-

        	        <lb/>we not anticipate? Scarcely three hundred

        	        <lb/>for the gratification? Let such be cautious of 
        	        <lb/>their propensities. You have heard, I sup-
        	        <lb break="no"/>pose, that an Emperor, Cardinal, or a gracious, 
        	        <lb/>sable-headed Pope, has issued an edict, laying 
        	        <lb/>claim to a certain territory, to which, no body 
        	        <lb/>ever mistrusted he was entitled. But the na-

        	        <lb/>He collects his forces, and marches to glory; 
        	        <lb/>kills millions, gains his conquest, renews his 
        	        <lb/>quarrels and puts others to the sword. His

        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        AND must the scourge of war again cast a

        	        <lb/>so dearly, unmindful of an infinite variety 
        	        <lb/>of alluring objects, that surround them, grow 
        	        <lb/>wanton in luxury and indolence, and thirst, 
        	        <lb/>like tygers, to imbrue their hands in the blood 
        	        <lb/>of any of the human race? GOD forbid! For 
        	        <lb/>in that day, the beast shall again retire to his 
        	        <lb/>lair; the bird shall clap its well fledged wing, 
        	        <lb/>and bear itself across the ocean; (HEAVEN 
        	        <lb/>grant it there may have a chance to land!) 
        	        <lb/>and the fish shall lie in torpitude, or refuse

        	        <lb/>the angler’s bait—but all, looking up to that 
        	        <lb/>sublime and exalted creature, MAN, bewail

        	        <lb/>them to his tranquil audience, in your silent, 
        	        <lb/>green-wood shade. From the city, the sailor 
        	        <lb/>shall quit your beauteous shores with reluc-
        	        <lb break="no"/>tance and with a sigh. And while old ocean 
        	        <lb/>is heaving his barque from his home, as your 
        	        <lb/>lessening turrets bluely fade to his view; he 
        	        <lb/>shall climb the mast—and while he is snatching

        	        <lb break="no"/>ry with every pleasurable and pensive sensa-
        	        <lb break="no"/>tion. And though separated from his natal

        	        AN extraordinary instance of <emph style="font-style: italic">virtue</emph> in 
        	        <lb/>a FEMALE SOLDIER, has occurred, lately in

        	        <pb/>
        	        <lb/>viz. a lively, comely young nymph, nineteen 
        	        <lb/>years of age, dressed in man’s apparel, has 
        	        <lb/>been discovered; and what redounds to her 
        	        <lb/>honor, she has served in the character of a 
        	        <lb/>soldier for nearly <emph style="font-style: italic">three years</emph>, undiscovered. 
        	        <lb/>During this time, she displayed much alertness, 
        	        <lb/>chastity and valor: having been in several en-
        	        <lb break="no"/>gagements, and received two wounds—a small

        	        <lb/>a remarkable, vigilant soldier on her post; al-

        	        THE cause of her personating a man, it is

        	        AS it is nothing strange, that any girl should 
        	        <lb/>be married, and have children; it is not to 
        	        <lb/>be expected, that one, distinguished, like <persName>Miss 
        	            <lb/>SAMPSON</persName>, should escape. The greatest dis-
        	        <lb break="no"/>tinction lies in the qualification for this im-
        	        <lb break="no"/>portant business. And, perhaps, the greatest 
        	        <lb/>requisite for EDUCATION is—complete union 
        	        <lb/>with the parties, both in theory and practice. 
        	        <lb/>This is remarkably verified in the <emph style="font-style: italic">party spirits</emph> 
        	        <lb/>that bring on wars and public calamities. 
        	        <lb/>They extend to the remote fire side.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        IT is hear-say, that <persName>Mrs. GANNET</persName> refuses 
        	        <lb/>her husband the rites of the marriage bed. 
        	        <lb/>She must, then, condescend to smile upon him 
        	        <lb/>in the silent alcove, or grass plat; as she has a 
        	        <lb/>child, that has scarcely left its cradle. It is pos-
        	        <lb break="no"/>sible, she experiences, not only corporal but 
        	        <lb/>mental inabilities; and in mercy to her gen-
        	        <pb/>
        	        <lb break="no"/>eration, would keep it in non-existence.—
        	        <lb/>But this is not the part of a biographer. I 
        	        <lb/>am sorry to learn, this is mostly female com-
        	        <lb break="no"/>plaint; and not authentic: For her nearest 
        	        <lb/>neighbors assert, there is a mutual harmony 
        	        <lb/>subsisting between her and her companion; 
        	        <lb/>which, by the bye, is generally the reverse 
        	        <lb/>with those deprived of this hymenial bliss. 
        	        <lb/>All who are acquainted with her, must ac-
        	        <lb break="no"/>knowledge her complaisant and humane dis-
        	        <lb break="no"/>positions. And while she discovers a taste 
        	        <lb/>for an elegant stile of living; she exhibits, 
        	        <lb/>perhaps, an unusual degree of contentment, 
        	        <lb/>with an honest farmer, and three endearing 
        	        <lb/>children, confined to a homely cot, and 
        	        <lb/>a hard-earned little farm.
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        SHE is sometimes employed in a school in 
        	        <lb/>her neighborhood. And her first maxim of 
        	        <lb/>the government of children is <emph style="font-style: italic">implicit obedi-
        	            <lb break="no"/>ence</emph>. I cannot learn, she has the least wish to 
        	        <lb/>usurp the prerogatives of our sex. For, she 
        	        <lb/>has often said, that nothing appears more beau-
        	        <lb break="no"/>tiful in the <emph style="font-style: italic">domestic round</emph>, than when the hus-
        	        <lb break="no"/>band takes the lead, with discretion, and is 
        	        <lb/>followed by his <seg xml:id="a149" corresp="#n149">consort,</seg><note xml:id="n149" corresp="#a149"><term style="font-style: italic">Consort</term>: partner, or mate.</note> with an amiable ac-
        	        <lb break="no"/>quiescence. She is, however, of opinion, 
        	        <lb/>that those women, who threaten their chil-
        	        <lb break="no"/>dren with, “<emph style="font-style: italic">I will tell your father</emph>”—of a crime, 
        	        <lb/>they should correct, is infusing into them a 
        	        <lb/>spirit of triumph, they should never know. 
        	        <lb/>The cultivation of humanity and good nature 
        	        <lb/>is the grand business of education. And she 
        	        <pb/>
        	        <lb/>has seen the ill effects of fighting, enough, to 
        	        <lb/>know the necessity of sparing clubs and cuffs 
        	        <lb/>at home. The same good temper, we would 
        	        <lb/>form in our offspring, should be exhibited in 
        	        <lb/>ourselves. We should neither use our chil-
        	        <lb break="no"/>dren as strangers; nor as the mere tools of fan-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ciful sport. All tampering and loose words 
        	        <lb/>with them, are, like playing, carelessly, with 
        	        <lb/>the lion or tiger, who will take advantage of 
        	        <lb/>our folly.—In short, instructions should be 
        	        <lb/>infused, as the dew distils; and discipline, nei-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ther rigid, nor tyrannic, should rest, like a 
        	        <lb/>stable pillar. 
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        	        HOW great—how sacred are our obliga-
        	        <lb break="no"/>tions to our offspring! Females, who are the 
        	        <lb/>vehicles, by which they are brought into the 
        	        <lb/>world, cannot consider, too seriously, the sub-
        	        <lb break="no"/>ject. Let it not be delayed, then, till that love, 
        	        <lb/>which coalesces the sexes, produces an object 
        	        <lb/>for experiment. Form a pre-affection for the 
        	        <lb/>sweet <emph style="font-style: italic">innocent</emph>, while in embryo—that it may 
        	        <lb/>be cherished, with prudence, when brought to 
        	        <lb/>view. And may we never have it to lament—
        	        <lb/>that while any females contemplate, with ab-
        	        <lb break="no"/>horrence, a <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph>, who voluntarily engages in 
        	        <lb/>the <emph style="font-style: italic">field</emph> of <emph style="font-style: italic">battle</emph>—<emph style="font-style: italic">they</emph> forget to recoil at the 
        	        <lb/>idea of coming off victorious from <emph style="font-style: italic">battles</emph>, 
        	        <lb/>fought by their own domestic—<emph style="font-style: italic">fire-sides!</emph>  We 
        	        <lb/>have now seen the distinction of one <emph style="font-style: italic">female</emph>. 
        	        <lb/>May it stimulate others to shine—in the way, 
        	        <lb/>that VIRTUE prescribes.
