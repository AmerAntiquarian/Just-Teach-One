# Just-Teach-One
[Just Teach One (JTO)](http://jto.common-place.org/) makes available open access, digital scholarly teaching editions of lesser known early American text. AAS houses the project, and Duncan Faherty (Queens College & the CUNY Graduate Center) and Ed White (Tulane University) select and prepare the text. Encoding is done through AAS and is supervised there by Molly Hardy. Please find the schema as well the XML of JTO texts here.
