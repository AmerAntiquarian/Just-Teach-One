     <p>
       THE history of illustrious vil-
       <lb break="no"/>lains ought to be effaced 
       <lb/>from the annals of nations, did not 
       <lb/>a faithful picture of their crimes 
       <lb/>serve to render them more odious. 
       <lb/>Writers who have deigned to em-
       <lb break="no"/>ploy their talents in exposing the 
       <lb/>depravity of some monsters, have, perhaps, 
       <lb/>contributed no less to the 
       <lb/>happiness of mankind than those 
       <lb/>who have exhibited only virtues.</p>
     <p>
       The negro who is the subject of 
       <lb/>the following relation, was not so 
       <lb/>fortunate as <persName>Mahomet</persName> or <persName>Crom-
         <lb break="no"/>well</persName>; but from what he did, the rea-
       <lb break="no"/>der may judge what he would have 
       <lb/>done, had he been placed in the 
       <lb/>same situation as these two ambi-

Beliefs and how they are experienced become important throughout the narrative.</note>.—There is no need 
       <lb/>to exaggerate the truth, to shew 
       <cb/>
       <lb/>how horrible and dangerous his 
       <lb/>projects were; for about twenty-
       <lb/>five years past, the people of <placeName><choice><sic>St.

       <lb/>been of illustrious rank, as he had 
       <lb/>received a much better education 
       <lb/>than what negroes generally have. 
       <lb/>He could read and write the Ara-
       <lb break="no"/>bian language, and he is not the

Given the ways in which Islam emphasizes literacy, the percentages of these enslaved people literate in Arabic has likewise also been typically underestimated.</note> <persName>Makandal</persName>

         <lb break="no"/>andal</persName> soon gained the esteem of 
       <lb/>his master, by his knowledge and 
       <lb/>industry, and made himself re-
       <lb break="no"/>spected by his fellow slaves, on ac-
       <lb break="no"/>count of the care which he took to 
       <lb/>procure them amusement, by mul-
       <lb break="no"/>tiplying their festivals, and to cure 
       <lb/>their disorders, after they had baf-
       <lb break="no"/>fled the skill of the European phy-
       <lb break="no"/>sicians. In a short time he was 
       <lb/>the soul of all their assemblies and 
       <lb/><seg xml:id="a009" corresp="#n009">dances,</seg><note xml:id="n009" corresp="#a009">The French original here reads “<quote>He soon was the soul of all the Calendas, a sort of dance gathering that the Negroes passionately love . . .</quote>”  The term <term style="font-style:italic">calenda</term>, or <term style="font-style:italic">calinda</term> as it more commonly appears, is Spanish in origin.</note> and from one end of the 
       <lb/>island to the other, the sick who 
       <lb/>were deemed incurable, invoked 
       <lb/>the name of <persName>Makandal</persName>, sending to 
       <lb/>ask from him the leaf or root of 
       <lb/>some herb, which for the most part 
       <lb/>relieved them.</p>
     <p>
       Young <persName>Makandal</persName> was known 
       <lb/>then only by his beneficence, and 
       <lb/>his great taste for pleasure. Hap-
       <lb break="no"/>py! had he always employed his 
       <lb/>talents for innocent purposes; but 
       <lb/>they soon became the source of the 
       <lb/>greatest crimes.</p>
     <p>
       At the age of 15 or 16, love began 
       <lb/>to inflame his breast and to rule 
       <lb/>with the most astonishing impetu-
       <lb break="no"/>osity. He did not, however, en-
       <lb break="no"/>tertain an exclusive passion for one 
       <lb/>object, but every woman who pos-
       <lb break="no"/>sessed any charms, received part of 
       <lb/>his homage, and inflamed his sen-
       <lb break="no"/>ses. His passion acquired energy 
       <lb/>and activity in proportion as the 
       <lb/>objects which inspired it were mul-
       <lb break="no"/>tiplied. In every quarter he had 
       <lb/>a mistress. It is well known that 
       <lb/>among the negroes, enjoyment soon 
       <lb/>follows <seg xml:id="a010" corresp="#n010">desire</seg><note xml:id="n010" corresp="#a010">The French original uses the term “jouissance” which has a stronger implication of sexual behavior.</note>; and that satiety and 
       <lb/>indifference are the usual consequences; but <persName>Makandal</persName>, on the 
       <lb/>contrary, appeared always to be 
       <cb/>
       <lb/>more enamoured of those who had 
       <lb/>contributed to his felicity, and a 
       <lb/>proud jealousy defended the em-
       <lb break="no"/>pire of his love.</p>
     <p>
       The overseer of the plantation 
       <lb/>to which he belonged fell in love 
       <lb/>with a beautiful young negro girl, 
       <lb/>who had attracted the notice also 
       <lb/>of <persName>Makandal</persName>. The reader may 
       <lb/>readily imagine how much embar-
       <lb break="no"/>rassed such a female must be, to 
       <lb/>fix her choice between a rigorous 
       <lb/>and despotic master, and the most 
       <lb/>distinguished of all the negroes in 
       <lb/>that part of the country: her heart, 
       <lb/>however, inclined towards her e-
       <lb break="no"/>qual, and the offers of the over-
       <lb break="no"/>seer were rejected.</p>
     <p>
       Enraged at this affront, he dis-
       <lb break="no"/>covered that <persName>Makandal</persName> had been 
       <lb/>the cause of it, and he vowed to be 
       <lb/>revenged; but Makandal, not-
       <lb break="no"/>withstanding his nocturnal <seg xml:id="a011" corresp="#n011">peregri-
         <lb break="no"/>nations,</seg><note xml:id="n011" corresp="#a011"><term style="font-style:italic">Peregrinations</term>: ramblings, random movements.</note> and the time which he de-
       <lb break="no"/>voted to pleasure, discharged his 
       <lb/>duty with so much punctuality and 
       <lb/>zeal, that he was never exposed to 
       <lb/>the least chastisement; a circum-
       <lb break="no"/>stance rather astonishing in a coun-
       <lb break="no"/>try where the lash is continually 
       <lb/>lacerating the bodies of the unhap-
       <lb break="no"/>py negroes, and where the soul of 
       <lb/>the European not yet <seg xml:id="a012" corresp="#n012">enured</seg><note xml:id="n012" corresp="#a012"><term style="font-style:italic">Enured</term>: habituated.</note> by 
       <lb/>custom to the most horrid specta-
       <lb break="no"/>cles, is filled with both terror and 
       <lb/>pity.</p>
     <p>
       The overseer, eagerly desirous 
       <lb/>of surprising <persName>Makandal</persName> in some 
       <lb/>fault, redoubled his vigilance, but 
       <lb/>in vain; the slave was always irre-
       <lb break="no"/>proachable. His rival, however, 
       <lb/>seeing that he could find no cause 
       <lb/>for punishing him, endeavored to 
       <lb/>invent a pretext; and one day, in 
       <lb/>the middle of a new plantation of 
       <lb/>sugar canes, he ordered him to be 
       <lb/>stretched out on his belly, and to 
       <lb/>receive fifty lashes. The pride of 
       <lb/><persName>Makandal</persName> revolted at this act of 
       <lb/>injustice. Instead of humbling 
       <lb/>himself, and imploring the prayers 
       <pb/>
       <lb/>and intercession of all the other 
       <lb/>slaves, who were filled with asto-
       <lb break="no"/>nishment and pity, he disdainfully 
       <lb/>cast his <seg xml:id="a013" corresp="#n013">implements of husbandry</seg><note xml:id="n013" corresp="#a013"><term style="font-style:italic">Implements of husbandry</term>: agricultural tools.</note> 
       <lb/>at the feet of his rival, telling him, 
       <lb/>that such a barbarous order was to 
       <lb/>him a signal of liberty, and imme-
       <lb break="no"/>diately running towards the moun-
       <lb break="no"/>tains, escaped, in spite of the over-
       <lb break="no"/>seer’s fury, and the pretended pur-
       <lb break="no"/>suit of the negroes, who gave them-
       <lb break="no"/>selves little trouble to overtake him.</p>
     <p>
       When he had thus saved himself 
       <lb/>from the unjust punishment of an 
       <lb/>European despot, he united himself 
       <lb/>to the <seg xml:id="a014" corresp="#n014">maroons;</seg><note xml:id="n014" corresp="#a014"><term style="font-style:italic">Maroons</term>: self-emancipated former slaves (or their descendants) or communities thereof. There were many large scale maroon communities in the <placeName>Caribbean</placeName> and <placeName>South America</placeName>, some in <placeName>North America</placeName> (in <placeName>Florida</placeName> and <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, for instance), and <placeName>Saint-Domingue’s mountainous region</placeName> provided shelter to many marrons from the earliest moment of colonization until the successful end of the Haitian Revolution.</note> that is to say, run-
       <lb break="no"/>away slaves; and twelve years 
       <lb/>elapsed before he could be appre-
       <lb break="no"/>hended. He still, however, kept 
       <lb/>up a correspondence with his for-
       <lb break="no"/>mer companions; never was there 
       <lb/>a festival of any consequence cele-
       <lb break="no"/>brated, at which he was not their

By the eighteenth century it had become a generic term for principal actor of a company.</note> But how came the 
       <lb/>negroes to betray their friend, their 
       <lb/>comforter, and their prophet? for 
       <lb/>he had address enough to make 
       <lb/>them at length believe that he had 
       <lb/>supernatural virtues, and divine 
       <lb/>revelations. Having carved out, 
       <lb/>with much art, upon the head of a 
       <lb/>stick made of the orange tree, a hu-
       <lb break="no"/>man figure, which, when pressed 
       <lb/>a little on the back part of the head, 
       <lb/>moved its eyes and lips, and ap-
       <lb break="no"/>peared to be animated, he pretended 
       <lb/>that this puppet answered whatever 
       <lb/>questions were put to it, and uttered 
       <lb/>oracles, and when he made it pre-
       <lb break="no"/>dict the death of any one, it is cer-
       <lb break="no"/>tain that he was never <seg xml:id="a016" corresp="#n016">mistaken.</seg><note xml:id="n016" corresp="#a016">
         <persName>Makandal’s</persName> carving—later referred to as his “image,” and called a “fétiche” or <term style="font-style:italic">fetish</term> in the French original, may have had roots in Sufi traditions from <placeName>Africa</placeName>. When the term <term style="font-style:italic">fetish</term> starts to appear in French dictionaries in the mid-eighteenth century, it is associated exclusively with “Nègres,” and is a pejorative term for primitive religious beliefs. Some of the earlier English translations—for example, that published by <bibl style="font­-style: italic">The Gentleman’s and London Magazine</bibl> in <date when="1788">1788</date>—did keep the term “fetiche,” adding the following note: “<term style="font-style:italic">Fetiche</term> is a name given in <placeName>Guinea</placeName> to their divinities; one of whom is supposed to preside over a whole province, and one over every family. The idol is a tree, the head of an ape, a bird, or any such thing as their fancy may suggest.” The term was relatively new in English-language writing, and the <bibl style="font-style:italic">OED</bibl> suggests it became more common in next two decades.</note></p>
     <p>
       The great knowledge which 
       <lb/><persName>Makandal</persName> had of <seg xml:id="a017" corresp="#n017">simples,</seg><note xml:id="n017" corresp="#a017"><term style="font-style:italic">Simples</term>: medical herbs and plant life.</note> enabled 
       <lb/>him to discover in <placeName>St. Domingo</placeName> se-
       <lb break="no"/>veral poisonous plants; and by 
       <lb/>these above all he acquired great 
       <lb/>reputation.—Without explaining 
       <lb/>the means which he made use of, 
       <lb/>he would foretel that such or such 
       <lb/>another male or female negro, 
       <lb/>who sometimes lived at the distance

       <lb/>die that very day, or next morning; 
       <lb/>and those who heard him utter this 
       <lb/>denunciation, soon learned with 
       <lb/>terror that his prediction was ac-
       <lb break="no"/>complished.</p>
     <p>
       The manner in which he com-
       <lb break="no"/>mitted crimes which were not dis-

       <lb/>—love, for which he incessantly

       WHEN the dance was ended,

  <lb/>few happy moments together; and 
  <lb/>when they were obliged to separate,

  <lb/>as often as they possibly could. La-
  <lb break="no"/>bor employed each of them dur-
  <lb break="no"/>ing the day; but when the sun sunk 
  <lb/>below the horizon, they met at a 
  <lb/>private place, where, amidst a grove

         <lb/>who has hitherto disdained the vows 
         <lb/>of all her admirers, and who, for 
         <lb/>more than a year, has mortified me 
         <cb/>
         <lb/>with continued refusals. Ask her 
         <lb/>to partake of some refreshment 
         <lb/>with you, and when she is about to 
         <lb/>eat, dexterously put this powder in-

       <persName>Zami</persName>, struck with these words,

         <lb/>said, ‘O! <persName>Makandal</persName>, why shouldest 
         <lb/>thou require me to sacrifice to thy 
         <lb/>vengeance the most perfect beau-

       <p>
       Whilst he was uttering these 
       <lb/>words, he embraced the knees of 
         <lb/>the ferocious <persName>Makandal</persName>, who, fired 
         <lb/>with indignation at seeing a hap-
         <lb break="no"/>py rival, had drawn his cutlass, 
         <lb/>and would have doubtless sacrific-
         <lb break="no"/>ed him to his vengeance, had he 
         <lb/>not heard the voices of some Eu-
         <lb break="no"/>ropeans, who were calling the 
         <lb/>slaves to their labor. He had 
         <lb/>time, therefore, only to save him-
         <lb break="no"/>self with precipitation, and, with-
         <lb break="no"/>out reflecting on the consequen-
         <lb break="no"/>ces, left the poisonous powder in 
         <lb/>the hands of <persName>Zami</persName>.</p>
       <p>
       <persName>Zami</persName> immediately resolved to 
         <lb/>make a full discovery to the over-
         <lb break="no"/>seer; but he still feared <persName>Makandal</persName>, 
         <lb/>whose <seg xml:id="a037" corresp="#n037">image</seg><note xml:id="n037" corresp="#a037">Fetish in the original.</note> he dreaded, and on 
         <lb/>that account he thought it prudent 
         <lb/>to be silent.</p>
       <p>
       The day appeared to him to be 
       <lb/>insupportably long. He was op-
         <lb break="no"/>pressed with sadness and uneasi-
         <lb break="no"/>ness; but, at length, when his 
         <lb/>labor was ended, he flew to meet 
         <lb/>his beloved <persName>Samba</persName>, and repaired 
         <lb/>to the orange grove.</p>
       <pb/>
       <p>
       <persName>Samba</persName> had not yet arrived. Her 
         <lb/>lover waited a long time with 
         <lb/>inexpressible impatience, agitated 
         <lb/>between hope and fear. Every 
         <lb/>moment he imagined he heard the 
         <lb/>sound of steps; the least noise, 
         <lb/>the slightest agitation of the trees 
         <lb/>heightened his illusion, and made his 
         <lb/>heart beat with joy. But perceiv-
         <lb break="no"/>ing that the hour of appointment 
         <lb/>was passed, the most dismal fore-
         <lb break="no"/>bodings took possession of his soul; 
         <lb/>he gave himself up to the most ter-
         <lb break="no"/>rible conjectures, and he at length 
         <lb/>lost all hopes of seeing the dear ob-

         <lb/>hastened to the habitation of <persName>Sam-

         <lb/>to inform himself what had be-

       <p>
       But who can describe the terror, 
       <lb/>the grief, and the despair of the 
         <lb/>unfortunate <persName>Zami</persName>, when, on ap-

         <lb/>out on a mat; he threw himself 
         <lb/>towards her, upon which, lifting 
         <lb/>up her dying eyes, she stretched 
         <lb/>out her hand and expired, pro-
         <lb break="no"/>nouncing the name of <persName>Zami</persName>.</p>
       <p>
       <persName>Zami</persName> fell motionless by her side; 
         <lb/>he was carried away senseless, and

       <p>
       He armed himself only with a 
       <lb/>club made of the wood of the guava 
         <lb/>tree, and lay hid to watch him in a 
         <lb/>narrow pass of the mountain to 
         <lb/>which <persName>Makandal</persName> had retired.—
         <lb/>There he waited for five days, but 
         <lb/>on the sixth, before the dawn of 
         <lb/>day, he heard him marching along 
         <lb/>with two or three other maroons. 
         <lb/><persName>Zami</persName> immediately starting up, 
         <lb/>knocked down <persName>Makandal’s</persName> two 
         <lb/>companions. <persName>Makandal</persName> drew his 
         <lb/>cutlass to make a stroke at <persName>Zami</persName>, 
         <lb/>who, with a blow of his club, 
         <lb/>made him drop it from his <seg xml:id="a043" corresp="#n043">hand,</seg><note xml:id="n043" corresp="#a043">The French includes the following clause: “<quote>and knocked him [<persName>Makandal</persName>] to the ground himself.</quote>”</note> 
         <lb/>and immediately rushing upon 
         <lb/>him, held him fast, and having ti-
         <lb break="no"/>ed his hands behind his back with 
         <lb/>his long girdle, conducted him to 
         <lb/><placeName>the Cape</placeName>.</p>
       <p>
       Some of <persName>Makandal’s</persName> accompli-
         <lb break="no"/>ces were arrested also, and when 
         <lb/>put to the rack, confessed the se-
         <lb break="no"/>cret of the poison. They did 
         <lb/>more—they declared that <persName>Makan-
           <lb break="no"/>dal’s</persName> intention was to destroy pri-
         <lb break="no"/>vately the greater part of the plan-
         <lb break="no"/>ters, or to ruin them, by poison-
         <lb break="no"/>ing all their slaves who appeared 
         <lb/>to be attached to them; and last-
         <lb break="no"/>ly to exterminate the whole race of 
         <lb/>white men by a general massacre 
         <lb/>which would render him the deli-
         <lb break="no"/>verer and sovereign of the whole 
         <lb/>island. The truth of this dread-
         <lb break="no"/>ful conspiracy was confirmed by 
         <lb/>the evidence of several other con-
         <lb break="no"/>fidants of <seg xml:id="a044" corresp="#n044"><persName>Makandal</persName>;</seg><note xml:id="n044" corresp="#a044">In the French original, this paragraph begins: “<quote>Among the accomplices of <persName>Makandal</persName>, <persName>Teysselo</persName> &amp; Mayombé were also arrested and under torture confessed the secret of the poisons.</quote>” The sentences about the broader conspiracy appear to have been added in <date when="1789">1789</date> in the version published in the <bibl style="font­-style: italic">LMBR</bibl>.</note> but he him-
         <lb break="no"/>self would never confess any 
         <lb/>thing; he retained his audacity 
         <lb/>and fanaticism even in the midst 
         <lb/>of the flames. He declared haught-
         <lb break="no"/>ily from the top of the pile, that 
         <lb/>the fire would respect his body; 
         <pb/>
         <lb/>that instead of dying, he would 
         <lb/>only change his form; and that 
         <lb/>he would always remain in the 
         <lb/>island, either as a large knat, bird, 
         <lb/>or a serpent, to protect his <seg xml:id="a045" corresp="#n045">nation.</seg><note xml:id="n045" corresp="#a045">This sentence was also added to the English translation. <term style="font-style:italic">Knat</term>: gnat.</note> 
         <lb/>His discourse made the ignorant

         <lb/>would save him; a singular cir-
         <lb break="no"/>cumstance appeared even for a 
         <lb/>moment to favor such an opini-
         <lb break="no"/>on. A post had been driven in-
         <lb break="no"/>to the earth, around which a pile 
         <lb/>of <seg xml:id="a047" corresp="#n047">faggots</seg><note xml:id="n047" corresp="#a047"><term style="font-style:italic">Faggots</term>: bundles of sticks, kindling.</note> was raised, and <persName>Ma-
           <lb break="no"/>kandal</persName> was fixed to the stake by 
         <lb/>means of a wooden collar. The 
         <lb/>efforts which he made when fire 
         <lb/>was put to the pile were so violent 
         <lb/>that he tore up the stake, and 
         <lb/>walked ten or twelve paces with it 
         <lb/>in the midst of the spectators. All 
         <lb/>the negroes immediately cried out, 
         <cb/>
         <lb/>a miracle! but a soldier who hap-
         <lb break="no"/>pened to be near, soon shewed by 
         <lb/>a stroke of his sabre, that he was 
         <lb/>more powerful than the pretended 
         <lb/>prophet; and he was once more 
         <lb/>thrown into the pile, where he 
         <lb/>suffered the punishment which he 
         <lb/>so justly <seg xml:id="a048" corresp="#n048">deserved.</seg><note xml:id="n048" corresp="#a048"><term style="font-style:italic">. . . where he suffered the punishment which he so justly deserved.</term>This concluding clause was also added in the <date when="1789">1789</date> British version, as was the next small paragraph about poisonings in <placeName>St. Domingo</placeName>.</note></p>
       <p>
       Such was the origin of the de-
         <lb break="no"/>vastations occasioned by poison in 
         <lb/>the island of <placeName>St. Domingo</placeName>, where 
         <lb/>such practices are become more 
         <lb/>rare, thought they are not yet en-
         <lb break="no"/>tirely eradicated.</p>
       <p>
       As for <persName>Zami</persName>, when he had a-
         <lb break="no"/>venged the unfortunate <persName>Samba</persName>, he 
         <lb/>put himself to death, in hopes of 
         <lb/>meeting with a lover, without 
         <lb/>whom he considered life as an in-
         <lb break="no"/>supportable burden.</p>
