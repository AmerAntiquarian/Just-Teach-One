        <p> “THESE are sweet nosegays, ma- <lb break="no"/>dam,” said a little girl of about ten
          years <lb/>of age to a lady in a coach, whose horses <lb/>had been stopped by the driver
          to repair <lb/>a breach in the <seg xml:id="a002" corresp="#n002">traces.</seg><note
            xml:id="n002" corresp="#a002"><term style="font-style: italic">Nosegays</term>: small
            bouquets; <term style="font-style: italic">traces</term>: ropes or leather straps
            attaching an animal’s harness to a carriage’s crossbar. Definitions in this and
            subsequent notes are drawn from the <bibl>Oxford English Dictionary</bibl>.</note> The
          lady had or- <lb break="no"/>dered the footman in attendance to open <lb/>the coach door,
          that she might have ocu- <lb break="no"/>lar proof there was no danger from the
          <lb/>fracture of the harness, “Will you not <lb/>buy?” asked the child, in a persuasive
          <lb/>tone, whilst a winning smile played about <lb/>her lips; “they were gathered by my
          mo- <lb break="no"/>ther with her own hands, and indeed I <lb/>tied them with white tape
          myself: the <lb/>pinks are beautiful; and see! the roses, <lb/>they are fresh: will you
          buy a nosegay?” </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> “Who is your mother, my dear?” <lb/>said the lady. </p>
        <p> “She is an old, and very poor woman, <lb/>madam. I have also a sister and brother
          <lb/>at home.” </p>
        <p> “And have you no father, my child?” <lb/>inquired the lady. </p>
        <p> “O yes! madam. My father was an <lb/>old officer in the army. He is very sick- <lb
            break="no"/>ly; but he works now and then in the <lb/>garden; and in rainy weather he
          teaches <lb/>my sister, my brother, and myself, to <lb/>read—we read lessons every
          evening.” </p>
        <p> “Really! and whereabout is your <lb/>home?” </p>
        <p> “It is not a great way off, madam: you <lb/>may see our house from this very spot:
          <lb/>look! don’t you see that chimney yonder, <lb/>where the smoke comes from behind a
          <lb/>poplar tree?” </p>
        <p> “I do, my dear,” replied the lady: <lb/>“and I will purchase three of your nose- <lb
            break="no"/>gays. How do you sell them?” </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> “A penny a piece, madam.” </p>
        <p> “There is a five-penny piece for you, <lb/>my child; and I wish you a speedy sale
          <lb/>for the remainder. You need not mind <lb/>the change.” </p>
        <p> By this time the coachman had repaired <lb/>the damage which the traces had sustain- <lb
            break="no"/>ed, and had remounted his box. The <lb/>footman had closed the door, and was
          <lb/>about to take his station in the rear of the <lb/>carriage, when his mistress called
          to him <lb/>to run after the girl and ask her name. He <lb/>performed the service in a few
          seconds, <lb/>and returning, told her that the child c <lb/>alled herself
            <persName>Rosa</persName>. </p>
        <p> “<persName>Rosa</persName>;” repeated she, and gently re- <lb break="no"/>clined herself
          against the velvet lining <lb/>of her carriage. The driver, with a flourish <lb/>and a
          crack of his whip, put his horses in <lb/>brisk motion.— </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Mrs. Dorinda Charmion</persName> was a woman <lb/>of about fifty years of age,
          and was still <lb/>an agreeable object of attraction in the gay <pb/>
          <lb/>world, the pleasures of which she ration- <lb break="no"/>ally enjoyed without being
          their slave. <lb/>Her person was majestic, her complexion <lb/>was fair and florid, her
          hair black, her <lb/>eyes of a similar colour and peculiarly <lb/>penetrating, having at
          the same time a <lb/>soft melancholy expression in them; and <lb/>they were almost sure to
          captivate those <lb/>who frequently came within their gaze: <lb/>her lips were pleasingly
          red, and her teeth <lb/>were very white. All these beauties of per- <lb break="no"/>son
          had made considerable havock among <lb/>the other sex in her youth, and it was not
          <lb/>extraordinary that they still maintained a <lb/>strong influence over the hearts of
          men. <lb/>Her mental perfections were also admira- <lb break="no"/>ble; she was sensible,
          discreet, and bene- <lb break="no"/>volent. Nature had, indeed, done for her <lb/>more
          than education. Her mind was natu- <lb break="no"/>rally acute and discriminating, but she
          <lb/>had not enjoyed perfectly the benefit of a <lb/>school: in a great degree she was
          self- <lb/>taught; yet, experience drawn from her <pb/>
          <lb/>intercourse with the world, and close ob- <lb break="no"/>servation of the rules of
          society, had im- <lb break="no"/>proved her into an accomplished lady, <lb/>and furnished
          her with a stock of ideas <lb/>whence she drew the maxims of her life. <lb/>These maxims
          were to her a more certain <lb/>guide than all the theoretical catechisms <lb/>which
          moping and recluse moralists have <lb/>penned for the regulation of human con- <lb
            break="no"/>duct. It was <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> to whom
            <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName> had sold three nosegays. </p>
        <p> But notwithstanding that this lady, at <lb/>the age of fifty, possessed the graces of
          <lb/>person and the accomplishments of mind, <lb/>which, in the estimation of men of
          sense, <lb/>can alone make a woman amiable, in her <lb/>earlier days her bosom had been
          torn by <lb/>desires and passions, which, after a con- <lb break="no"/>flict of twenty
          years, she had scarcely <lb/>been able to conquer. Time, however, <lb/>which yields the
          only balm for corro- <lb break="no"/>ding grief and wasting melancholy, had
          <lb/>eventually soothed the sorrows of her <pb/>
          <lb/>heart, and given to her mind that philo- <lb break="no"/>sophical equability, which
          is the essence <lb/>of happiness. The pleasing and animated <lb/>countenance of the child,
          the innocent and <lb/>bewitching dimples which accompanied <lb/>her smiles when she
          offered her flowers for <lb/>sale, had sensibly affected the feelings of
            <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, and the excitement was <lb/>not at all lessened
          when she learnt that <lb/>the girl’s name was <persName>Rosa</persName>; a name which
          <lb/>at once combines the image of simplicity <lb/>and that of elegance. </p>
        <p> There are moments when we are more <lb/>strongly under the influence of sympathy
          <lb/>between recollections of former objects <lb/>and those which are present to us, than
          <lb/>we are at other times. When the mind <lb/>is contemplative, enlarging the horizon of
          <lb/>its view to the whole scene of mortal ex- <lb break="no"/>istence, our vanity and our
          pride suffer <lb/>a <seg xml:id="a003" corresp="#n003">salutary abrasion,</seg><note
            xml:id="n003" corresp="#a003"><term style="font-style: italic">Salutary abrasion</term>:
            a healthy wearing away.</note> and our thoughts are <lb/>mellowed into the happy
          temperament of <lb/>resignation to the circumstances which <pb/>
          <lb/>surround us. Such an intellectual dispo- <lb break="no"/>sition attunes the temper of
          our nature to <lb/>the finest feelings of which it is suscepti- <lb break="no"/>ble, and
          is peculiarly propitious to the <lb/>sentiment of humanity. <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName>
          <lb/>had been musing in her coach for half <lb/>an hour before the traces broke; the ac-
            <lb break="no"/>cident merely served to give a higher <lb/>degree of sensibility to her
          thoughts, <lb/>which at that instant were bent upon the <lb/>frailty of human life. As the
          footman <lb/>opened the door, <persName>Rosa</persName> presented herself <lb/>with a
          basket of nosegays, dressed in a <lb/>neat white short gown and a petticoat of <lb/>green

          <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>; for she had been a mo- <lb break="no"/>ther, and
          had once entertained fond and <lb/>sanguine hopes of rearing a blooming and <lb/>a happy
          offspring. </p>

          of those numerous and <lb/>delightful country seats which surround <lb/>and adorn that
          flourishing city. The <lb/>place was a gift from her father, who had <lb/>amassed an
          immense fortune, and died <lb/>clear of debt, and in the full and lawful <lb/>possession
          of his riches. When <persName>Rosa</persName>
          <lb/>presented herself to <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, that <lb/>lady was on her
          way from her villa to <lb/>the city, intending to make a few morn- <lb break="no"/>ing
          visits, to purchase some articles from <lb/>the shops, and to return home before the
          <lb/>hour of dinner. In the circle of her ac- <lb break="no"/>quaintances there was a
          gentleman who <lb/>was known by the name of <persName>Derwent</persName>. He <lb/>was
          reputed a bachelor, turned of fifty <lb/>years of age, tall, well shaped, and of a
          <lb/>grave aspect. <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> was a per- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>son that was generally well received <lb/>wherever he went, for he knew
          the valu- <lb break="no"/>able art of rendering himself acceptable <lb/>without being
          frivolous; and of mixing in <lb/>familiar conversation without the alloy of
          <lb/>vulgarity. He usually enjoyed the confi- <lb break="no"/>dence of those with whom he
          associated, <lb/>and although some portion of the history <lb/>of his life was
          mysteriously veiled from <lb/>their knowledge, yet he passed among <lb/>them, and in the
          world at large, for a man <lb/>of virtue and a worthy member of society. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, notwithstanding he was <lb/>a bachelor, kept a well
          furnished house <lb/>and a coach. He was known to be gene- <lb break="no"/>rous to merit,
          and liberal in the enter- <lb break="no"/>tainment of his friends. </p>
        <p> As <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> was discussing <lb/>within herself which of her
          city acquaint- <lb break="no"/>ances she should visit first, her fancy <lb/>suggested to
          her the idea of rallying the <lb/>old bachelor by stopping at his door, <lb/>and
          presenting him, by the hand of her <pb/>
          <lb/>footman, with one of the three nosegays <lb/>which she had purchased from
            <persName>Rosa</persName>. <lb/>There was something so innocently mis- <lb break="no"
          />chievous in the notion of this little piece <lb/>of gallant pleasantry, that she
          resolved <lb/>to put it in execution. Accordingly, hav- <lb break="no"/>ing driven into
          the city, to the quarter <lb/>where his dwelling was situated, she stop- <lb break="no"
          />ped before the door, and ordered the ser- <lb break="no"/>vant to convey, with her
          compliments, <lb/>a nosegay to <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>. The footman <lb/>having
          obeyed her commands, came to <lb/>the carriage door and told her the gentle- <lb
            break="no"/>man was surrounded with company; in <lb/>the next instant, <persName>Mr.
            Derwent</persName> himself <lb/>appeared before <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, and
          re- <lb break="no"/>spectfully bowed. He thanked her in po- <lb break="no"/>lite terms for
          her present, whilst an <seg xml:id="a007" corresp="#n007">arch</seg><note xml:id="n007"

            mischievous.</note>
          <lb/>smile, which dwelt for a moment upon <lb/>his lips, informed her that the <emph
            style="font­-style: italic">bachelor</emph>
          <lb/>felt the full force of her gentle raillery: <lb/>at the same time he invited her to
          step <lb/>from her coach into the house for a few <pb/>
          <lb/>minutes, where, he told her, she would <lb/>find several of her acquaintances of both
          <lb/>sexes. With an air of well regulated <lb/>gaiety she accepted his invitation, and
          <lb/>proceeding to the parlour found a group <lb/>of at least a dozen of her friends, who
          <lb/>were rejoiced to see her, and who all press- <lb break="no"/>ed her to pay them a
          visit. Without giving <lb/>either of them a decided promise, but <lb/>returning their
          salutations with a cor- <lb break="no"/>diality equal to their own, her attention <lb/>was
          attracted to a very handsome youth <lb/>of about fifteen years of age, who stood <lb/>by
          an empty chair, in a very graceful <lb/>posture, with a manuscript paper in his <lb/>hand,
          as if in the act of reading. <persName>Mr. <lb/>Derwent</persName> having urged all the
          company <lb/>to be seated, took possession of a vacant <lb/>chair, and informed
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> that <lb/>at the moment she arrived, he had been
          <lb/>entertaining his friends with a short lit- <lb break="no"/>erary production by a
          young friend of his. <lb/>“And my dear <persName>Richard</persName>,” said he, turn- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ing to the boy, “as you have not pro- <lb break="no"/>ceeded very far in
          the reading of it, you <lb/>will oblige me by beginning it again, so <lb/>that our friend
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> may have <lb/>the entire benefit of the whole
          composi- <lb break="no"/>tion.” <persName>Richard</persName> gently curved himself, in
          <lb/>token of willing assent, and resuming his <lb/>posture, he read aloud, in an
          agreeable <lb/>tone, and with a well judged emphasis, <lb/>the following production: </p>

              <persName>Goldsmith</persName> had made a career of publishing gossipy books about the

          <lb/>I hope they will improve the work with <lb/>the addition of the gossip. This can
          <lb/>be the more easily effected, inasmuch as <lb/>there need be no extraordinary expense
          <lb/>incurred in procuring an engraving of <lb/>its figure, for any likeness of a thing
          that <lb/>walks upon two legs will answer the pur- <lb break="no"/>pose, with a little
          variation of the mouth, <lb/>which is sometimes peculiar in this ani- <lb break="no"/>mal;
          but the peculiarity is not always <lb/>emphatically marked. </p>
        <p> “The gossip is a biped, various in <lb/>stature and bulk, with a human face, <pb/>
          <lb/>which is sometimes beautiful and some- <lb break="no"/>times ugly. The peculiarity of
          mouth al- <lb break="no"/>ready spoken of, is a certain elasticity <lb/>of the lips, which
          are alternately pursed <lb/>up and protruded by wind; and, gene- <lb break="no"/>rally,
          the quickness or slowness of these <lb/>evolutions of the lips denotes the perfec- <lb
            break="no"/>tion or imperfection of the creature. It <lb/>will save a tedious
          description briefly to <lb/>remark, that the gossip is commonly al- <lb break="no"/>lowed
          to be of the human species, and on <lb/>that account is tolerated; and, when well
          <lb/>dressed, is even admitted into decent and <lb/>fashionable circles of society. </p>
        <p> “The most prominent characteristic of <lb/>this animal, is the unwearied pains which
          <lb/>it takes to repeat to almost every person <lb/>it sees almost every thing it hears;
          and <lb/>when it cannot get an opportunity to dis- <lb break="no"/>burthen itself of a
          secret or of a scandal- <lb break="no"/>ous story, its lips are extremely agitated
          <lb/>with that singular motion of which I have <lb/>previously spoken. The female will
          ride <lb/>or walk about for a whole day among its <pb/>
          <lb/>acquaintances, in order to propagate a <lb/>little tale which she has heard against a
          <lb/>neighbour or a stranger newly arrived in <lb/>town. The joy which she manifests in
          <lb/>venting the circumstances of the case is <lb/>a never failing indication that she is
          a true <lb/>gossip. Some of them, however, as they <lb/>grow old grow cunning, and will
          endea- <lb break="no"/>vour to conceal their satisfaction at the <lb/>opportunity of
          relating what they have <lb/>heard, by interlarding their narrative with <lb/>a few
          qualifications, such as that “<hi rend="italic">he is <lb/>a smart fellow, and
            if</hi>”—“<hi rend="italic">she formerly <lb/>was a fine virtuous girl, but</hi>”—“<hi
            rend="italic">I can <lb/>hardly believe the story myself, yet my <lb/>authority is of
            the best kind</hi>”—always, as <lb/><persName>Pope</persName> says, taking care to wound
          the re- <lb break="no"/>putation of their victim, by “damning <lb/>with faint <seg

          complaint, <lb/>he could not find that his conjecture was <lb/>right. He would have
          returned home <lb/>immediately for a few restorative drops, <lb/>but she insisted on his
          tarrying, and be- <lb break="no"/>gan directly to tell him a long story of a
          <lb/>courtship which had been broken off, as <lb/>it was supposed with very peculiar symp-
            <lb break="no"/>toms. On the conclusion of her narra- <lb break="no"/>tive, she was
          perfectly restored to health, <lb/>and her countenance brightened with a <lb/>beam of
          satisfaction. The effect of this <lb/>disposition in the female is generally lu- <lb
            break="no"/>dicrous, but sometimes serious. A few <lb/>motherly old ladies, by her
          means, are <lb/>occasionally kept in the pouts with each <lb/>other for the whole year
          round; maid- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ens are induced to quarrel with their <lb/>lovers; and, now and then, a
          match that <lb/>would produce the happiness of the par- <lb break="no"/>ties is broken
          off. </p>
        <p> “The male gossip proceeds in the same <lb/>manner as the female, but is infinitely
          <lb/>more mischievous and disgusting. The <lb/>female, in common, circulates her stories
          <lb/>over a dish of tea, or in the drawing-room; <lb/>but the male, roaming about, accosts
          eve- <lb break="no"/>ry acquaintance he meets in a sort of half- <lb/>whisper, much to
          this purport: “<hi rend="italic">Have you <lb/>heard that Mr.</hi>”—or, “<hi rend="italic"
            >have you under- <lb break="no"/>stood that Mrs.</hi>”—“<hi rend="italic">Good heavens!
            it is <lb/>very distressing; but don’t mention a word <lb/>of it for the world.</hi>”
          Sometimes he dilates <lb/>over the bottle, breeding heart-burnings, <lb/>squabbles, and
          deadly quarrels. Duels <lb/>are not unfrequently the consequence of <lb/>these
          propensities in the male; whence <lb/>the reader may learn that the gossip, both <lb/>male
          and female, but more particularly <lb/>the male, is an unpleasant, and often a
          <lb/>dangerous companion.” </p>
        <p> “Well done, <persName>Richard</persName>,” said <persName>Mr. Der- <lb break="no"
            />went</persName>, as the youth concluded his literary <lb/>performance; “I really think
          we must <lb/>have your piece published in the news- <lb break="no"/>papers.” </p>
        <p> “O fie! <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>;” exclaimed <lb/>one of the ladies present;
          “you would <lb/>not put it in the gazette, would you?” </p>
        <p> “Why, indeed, madam,” answered <lb/><persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, “I think it would

          and, therefore, I am for publishing <lb/>it in one of our public prints.” </p>
        <p> “A precious resolution, verily,” cried <lb/>a gay gentleman, who was an attendant
          <lb/>upon one of the ladies. “What! post it <lb/>in one of the scandalous chronicles of

        <p> “I confess,” said <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, “that <lb/>our gazettes are not
          conducted with that <lb/>taste, ability, and decorum, which I <lb/>should be pleased to
          see prevail; but this <lb/>is chiefly because public patronage is <lb/>not liberal enough
          to render it an object <lb/>for men of talents to undertake the ma- <lb break="no"
          />nagement of them, and from the facility <lb/>with which almost every man of suffi- <lb
            break="no"/>cient impudence can become the editor <lb/>of a journal of news and politics
          in this <lb/>country. Yet let us recollect, that if the <lb/>invectives, with which our
          newspapers <lb/>abound, be too coarse and disgusting for <lb/>persons of refined
          understandings, the <lb/>vices of these times are more deeply <lb/>rooted, bold, and
          detestable, than for- <lb break="no"/>merly; and require to be cut up with a <lb/>sharp
          instrument and a strong hand. The <lb/>gentle rebukes and delicate ridicule of <pb/>
          <lb/><persName>Addison</persName> and those of his day, if our <lb/>writers <emph
            style="font­-style: italic">could</emph> imitate them, might, in- <lb break="no"/>deed,
          be admired, but would scarcely <lb/>be heeded.” </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> put an end to the con- <lb break="no"/>troversy, by
          remarking that she had once <lb/>heard her father say, it was a good rule <lb/>for an
          author to lock up his manuscript <lb/>for ten years; after which, if, on read- <lb
            break="no"/>ing it, he still approved of the piece, he <lb/>might with safety venture to
          publish it. <lb/>This course she recommended to <persName>Rich- <lb break="no"
            />ard</persName>. “But I suspect, <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>,” <lb/>said she,
          “that this is one of your own <lb/>productions, and that the reading of it by <lb/>that
          youth as his performance, is a little <lb/>stratagem you have contrived in order <lb/>to
          extort our real opinions of your lite- <lb break="no"/>rary merits. Come! among friends
          there <lb/>should be no reserve; be candid, and <lb/>confess.” </p>
        <p> “Upon my word, madam,” said <persName>Mr. <lb/>Derwent</persName>, “it is the production
          of <persName>Rich- <lb break="no"/>ard</persName> himself.” </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> The boy blushed; and respectfully re- <lb break="no"/>quested leave to retire.
            <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>
          <lb/>nodded his permission; and <persName>Richard</persName>, <lb/>bowing to the ladies
          and gentlemen, left <lb/>the room. </p>
        <p> “The manuscript,” observed <persName>Mr.Der- <lb break="no"/>went</persName>, “I will

        <p> “I am glad to find,” she replied <lb/>with a smile, “if I have no influence <lb/>with
          the <emph style="font­-style: italic">literati</emph> themselves, that I have <lb/>some

        <p> “<emph style="font­-style: italic">Parents</emph>! did you say?” cried one <lb/>of the
          ladies, purposely mistaking the <lb/>word. “Why, dear me, <persName>Mr.
          Derwent</persName>, <lb/>I thought you had no son?” </p>
        <p> “The boy is no son of mine, madam, <lb/>I assure you,” answered <persName>Mr.
            Derwent</persName>. <lb/>“His history is short, but interesting. <lb/>However, you will
          excuse me from re- <lb break="no"/>citing it at present.” </p>
        <p> “A relation, then, perhaps, sir?” </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> “No, madam.” </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> had perceived from the <lb/>first, the curiosity of his
          visitor, and the <lb/>cunning of her pretending not to under- <lb break="no"/>stand the
          word “<term style="font-style: italic">patrons</term>.” To retaliate, <lb/>he provoked her
          inquisitive disposition <lb/>without gratifying it. </p>
        <p> “Who <emph style="font­-style: italic">can</emph> the boy be?” was the ques- <lb
            break="no"/>tion which every one present, except <persName>Mr. <lb/>Derwent</persName>,
          internally asked. But, as he <lb/>had manifested rather an unwillingness <lb/>to explain,
          politeness influenced the com- <lb break="no"/>pany to forbear pressing the inquiry far-
            <lb break="no"/>ther. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> arose to depart, intend- <lb break="no"/>ing to
          purchase what articles she want- <lb break="no"/>ed, drop in at a few places, and return
          to <lb/>her villa. She was, however, so impor- <lb break="no"/>tuned by several of the
          persons present <lb/>to stay in the city and dine, that she at <lb/>length consented;
          giving the preference <lb break="no"/>to <persName>Mr. and Mrs. Roaster</persName>, who
          had on <lb/>that day a dinner party at their house. <pb/>
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> declined being one of the <lb/>number, pleading a

        <p>
          <persName>Mr. and Mrs. Roaster</persName> were a happy <lb/>pair; of moderate worldly
          circumstances, <lb/>and neither of them very fond of fashion- <lb break="no"/>able life.
          They, however, mixed fre- <lb break="no"/>quently with the modish part of society,
          <lb/>more to divert themselves with the ec- <lb break="no"/>centricities which variety of

        <p> “Ah! my dear <persName>Mr. Roaster</persName>, “re- <lb break="no"/>plied
            <persName>Ecstacy</persName>, “how can you trifle with <lb/>the tender passion? You, who
          have so <lb/>fine an understanding, so penetrating a <lb/>genius, such profound sagacity,
          and are <lb/>so extremely capable of enjoying the ex- <lb break="no"/>quisite
          sensibilities of our nature!” </p>
        <p> “Me, sir! Pardon me, <persName>Mr. Ecstacy</persName>,” <lb/>said <persName>Mr.
            Roaster</persName>, “pardon me, I beseech <lb/>you: No man enjoys more delicious pul-
            <lb break="no"/>sations of the heart than I do at the utter- <lb break="no"/>ance of
          those captivating strains, which <pb/>
          <lb/>are the voice of the genius of love. And, <lb/>to tell the truth, (for why should the
          truth <lb/>be concealed,) I have often listened, <persName>Mr. <lb/>Ecstacy</persName>,
          with singular delight and satis- <lb break="no"/>faction, with amazing and overwhelming
          <lb/>rapture, to <emph style="font­-style: italic">your</emph> poetical productions,
          <lb/>when you have enlisted your talents in the <lb/>service of
          <persName>Cupid</persName>.” </p>
        <p> “O fie! <persName>Mr. Roaster</persName>,” said <persName>Ecstacy</persName>. </p>
        <p> “Fie, indeed,” answered <persName>Mr. Roaster</persName>; <lb/>“now ladies and
          gentlemen, I will hold a <lb/>wager, (although I deem betting to be a <lb/>bad practice,)
          that my acquaintance, <persName>Mr. <lb/>Ecclesiasticus Ecstacy</persName>, has in his
          pocket <lb/>at this moment an <bibl>Ode to the God of <lb/>Love; or to
              <persName>Venus</persName>, his mother</bibl>; or some <lb/>poetical piece of that
          description.” </p>
        <p> “O dear, <persName>Mr. Roaster</persName>,” said <persName>Ecstacy</persName>, <lb/>with
          a sympathetic simper. </p>
        <p> At that instant dinner was announced; <lb/>and the company, without hesitation, re- <lb
            break="no"/>paired to the well covered board of their <lb/>hospitable entertainer. </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> “I hope,” said <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, as she <lb/>seated herself at the
          table, “that we shall <lb/>have a poetical effusion from <persName>Mr. Ecstacy</persName>,
          <lb/>by way of dessert.” </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Ecstacy</persName>, with a complacent smirk, <lb/>bowed his head in token of
          willingness to <lb/>oblige the acquaintances of <persName>Mr. Roaster</persName>. </p>
        <p> Of all the modes which the imagina- <lb break="no"/>tions of men have conceived for
          combi- <lb break="no"/>ning sensual and intellectual gratifications, <lb/>that of rational
          domestic dinner-parties, <lb/>when the company is discreetly selected, <lb/>and
          correspondent in their general affec- <lb break="no"/>tions, is, perhaps, the most
          excellent. In <lb/>these there is commonly a mixture of <lb/>women, whose presence
          controls the ex- <lb break="no"/>cesses, and whose influence softens that <lb/>rudeness of
          manners, in which the other <lb/>sex are prone to indulge. It is highly <lb/>probable that
          the French owe the charac- <lb break="no"/>ter which they enjoy, of being remarka- <lb
            break="no"/>bly temperate, to the high rank which the <lb/>ladies hold in their social
          circles, and to <pb/>
          <lb/>the absolute power which they exercise <lb/>over opinion in matters of taste and re-
            <lb break="no"/>creation. The manners of the civilized <lb/>Americans, speaking with
          exceptions, are <lb/>English; and, agreeably to the custom of <lb/>those islanders, the
          pleasures of the bottle <lb/><emph style="font­-style: italic">after</emph> dinner have
          become too habitual <lb/>among such citizens of the <placeName>United States</placeName>
          <lb/>as aspire to any thing above mediocrity in <lb/>life. This practice, so pernicious in
          its <lb/>effects, (and which is checked by respect <lb/>for the fair sex,) if it is ever
          eradicated, <lb/>will owe its banishment to the magical <lb/>attractions of female
          society. The em- <lb break="no"/>pire of women is more potent than the <lb/>compulsions of
          law, for the same reason <lb/>that mankind are more easily led than <lb/>they are driven;
          and as we at present owe <lb/>our chief domestic enjoyments to the <lb/>good qualities of
          that amiable sex, it is <lb/>much to be hoped that the world will de- <lb break="no"/>rive
          from the same source future moral <lb/>improvements, which may make <seg xml:id="a020"
            corresp="#n020">temper- <pb/>
            <lb break="no"/>ance more fashionable, and vice more <lb/>obnoxious, than they are at
            present.</seg><note xml:id="n020" corresp="#a020"><term style="font-style: italic"
              >Temperance</term>: during this period, the term shifted in meaning from moderation in
            food and drink to total abstinence from alcohol. Anti-alcohol literature was
            increasingly common as <bibl style="font­-style: italic">Rosa</bibl> appeared in
            print.</note>
        </p>
        <p> But whatever the prevailing custom <lb/>may be, there was never exhibited at the
          <lb/>entertainment of <persName>Mr. Roaster</persName> any thing <lb/>like inebriety or
          indecorum. Good hu- <lb break="no"/>mour and a vein of delicate pleasantry <lb/>were
          freely admitted; but the shafts of <lb/>detraction were never launched at the <lb/>victim
          of malice in his presence; and the <lb/>individual who might have raised his <lb/>voice to
          calumniate an absent person, <lb/>would never more have met a welcome <lb/>within his
          doors. </p>
        <p> The ladies withdrew from dinner at a <lb/>seasonable opportunity, and the time <lb/>was
          not long before they were followed <lb/>by the gentlemen to the drawing-room, <lb/>which
            <persName>Mr. Ecclesiasticus Ecstacy</persName> had no <lb/>sooner entered than he was
          solicited for <lb/>an exhibition of his rhymes. </p>
        <p> “Why, ladies and gentlemen,” said <lb/><persName>Ecstacy</persName>, with an affected
          smile of humi- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>lity, “my friend <persName>Mr. Roaster</persName> is pleased <lb/>very
          much to overrate the facility of my <lb/>talents; for, although I do sometimes dip <lb/>a
          little into poesy, to be sure; yet it can <lb/>hardly be expected that I should always
          <lb/>carry about with me a new piece; but, I <lb/>protest, I believe <persName>Mr.
            Roaster</persName> has to-day <lb/>had a spy employed to watch my opera- <lb break="no"
          />tions; for, would you believe it! I hap- <lb break="no"/>pen in truth to have, on a leaf
          of my <lb/>pocket-book, a sonnet on that delight- <lb break="no"/>ful theme <term
            style="font-style: italic">Love</term>; and, since it appears to <lb/>be agreeable to
          the company, I will do <lb/>myself the honour of reading it.” Thus <lb/>saying,
            <persName>Ecstacy</persName> drew forth his pocket- <lb/>book, directed his eyes towards
          the ceil- <lb break="no"/>ing as he unclasped the repository of his <lb/>rhymes, knit his
          eye-brows with peculiar <lb/>significance, then cast a look on the floor, <lb/>gave a
          gentle, sighing <term style="font-style: italic">hem</term>, and having <lb/>fixed his
          gaze emphatically upon the Klb/page whereon his sonnet was written, he <lb/>read aloud as
          follows: <pb/>

          <lb/>felicity springs: It is of too passionate <lb/>and volatile a nature to be durable
          and <lb/>constant to a particular object. Beauty <lb/>is the common nourishment of love,
          and <lb/>beauty is perishable. There is a feeling <lb/>more mild and mellow, and much more <pb/>
          <lb/>lasting. I would call it the <emph style="font­-style: italic">devotion of <lb/>the
            heart</emph>. Its basis is esteem, and the <lb/>tenderest sympathy. It is permanent, be-
            <lb break="no"/>cause it is rational. It is pleasing because <lb/>it sweetly interests
          the most amiable <lb/>qualities of human nature. Those who <lb/>are sensible of its
          emotions are happy, <lb/>for they experience the true philosophy <lb/>of life.” </p>
        <p> By this just description of that cohe- <lb break="no"/>sive affinity, which is the
          proper cement <lb/>of virtuous minds, <persName>Mr. Ecclesiasticus <lb/>Ecstacy</persName>
          was recalled from his apostrophe <lb/>to Roman weakness and Trojan perfidy. <lb/>The
          opinion of <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> was deli- <lb break="no"/>vered with modest
          gravity, devoid of au- <lb break="no"/>sterity. <persName>Ecstacy</persName> fixed his
          eyes upon her <lb/>with a stare, which was not altogether <lb/>consistent with respectful
          politeness; he, <lb/>however, speedily withdrew them toward <lb/>his pocket-book, which
          had all this time <lb/>remained open in his hand. Clasping it, <lb/>he returned it to his
          pocket, put on a con- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>templative air, and silently seated himself <lb/>in a chair. </p>
        <p> “You condemn, then, my dear, good <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>,” said
            <persName>Miss Laetitia <lb/>Lively</persName>, “the fine love speeches which <lb/>make
          so conspicuous a portion of most <lb/>of our novels?” </p>
        <p> “Certainly,” replied <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>; “and for this reason,
            <persName>Laetitia</persName>; they give <lb/>a false colouring to life, and lead us to
          <lb/>expect enjoyments which it is not possi- <lb break="no"/>ble to realize.” </p>
        <p> “That is a very just observation, and <lb/>worthy of <persName>Mrs.
          Charmion</persName>,” remarked <lb/><persName>Mr. Roaster</persName>. “But, what is the
          matter <lb/>with my friend <persName>Mr. Ecstacy</persName>? He appears <lb/>as mournful
          and as melancholy as an ex- <lb break="no"/>hausted volcano.” </p>
        <p> “Truly, my spirits have evaporated, <lb/>and I beg you would spare me <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Roaster</persName>,” answered <persName>Ecstacy</persName>. “We who <lb/>soar to
          the sublimities of fancy, are sub- <lb break="no"/>ject, at every check we meet in our
          flights, <pb/>
          <lb/>to gloomy thoughts and sighs profound. <lb/>Ah! ladies and gentlemen, the acuteness
          <lb/>of my sensibilities is to me, too frequent- <lb break="no"/>ly, the cause of the most
          excruciating <lb/>intellectual tortures.” </p>
        <p> As <persName>Ecstacy</persName> finished his exclamation, <lb/>a pretty little white
          lap-dog, belonging <lb/>to a neighbouring family, which had in- <lb break="no"/>truded
          into the room, and was <seg xml:id="a026" corresp="#n026">curvet- <lb break="no"

          company, had entangled a <lb/>paw in the garment of one of <persName>Mr. Roast- <lb

          until he effected it by an <lb/>unlucky rent in the muslin. “Beast!” <lb/>roared
            <persName>Ecstacy</persName>, as he beheld the inci- <lb break="no"/>dent; and, as he
          spoke, seizing a bam- <lb break="no"/>boo cane, he aimed so fierce a blow at <lb/>the
          unconscious creature, that he broke <lb/>one of its legs. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> gave him a look of re- <lb break="no"/>proach. The lady
          whose garment had <lb/>been torn, forgot the circumstance in the <lb/>indulgence of her
          feelings of commise- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ration for the poor animal. Every one <lb/>present appeared ready to chide
          the ac- <lb break="no"/>tor of this needless cruelty. <persName>Mr. Roaster</persName>,
          <lb/>who was as deeply affected as the rest, <lb/>but was unwilling that
            <persName>Ecstacy</persName> should <lb/>be too much mortified, and at the same
          <lb/>time determined to reprove him for the <lb/>wanton act, gaily cried out, <seg

            <persName>Ecstacy</persName> felt all the force <lb/>of this sarcastic allusion to his
          boasted <lb/>sensibility, and sunk quiescently back <lb/>upon his chair. In a few moments,

          with suitable re- <lb break="no"/>flections; but the idea which fixed and <lb/>occupied
          her thoughts the most, was that <lb/>of <persName>Rosa</persName>. Without forming any
          decisive re- <lb break="no"/>solution, it occurred to her that she would <lb/>see the
          child again; and whilst this notion <lb/>was running in her head, she cast a glance
          <lb/>through the carriage window toward <lb/>the spot which had been pointed out to <pb/>
          <lb/>her as <persName>Rosa’s</persName> residence. She marked <lb/>it well; and found that
          it was at no great <lb/>distance from her own villa. “I will <lb/>send for the girl

        <p> The eastern limb of the sun disappear- <lb break="no"/>ed in the west as <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName> drove <lb/>up to the door of her mansion; and she <lb/>entered her
          habitation pensively musing, <lb/>but with spirits perfectly free from melan- <lb
            break="no"/>choly. The evening was chilly, and she <lb/>ordered a small fire to be
          lighted. It was <lb/>the usual custom for this lady to read for <lb/>one or two hours
          previously to retiring <lb/>to rest; and having arranged her house- <lb/>hold affairs as
          was her common practice, <lb/>she took up a volume of essays selected <lb/>from the works

          <lb/>From the concise but luminous moral <lb/>productions of that venerable sage she
          <lb/>had often derived instruction. The hour <lb/>of nine arrived, and <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName> was <lb/>still engaged in the perusal of her fa- <lb break="no"
          />vourite volume. “<persName>Susan</persName>,” said she, ad- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>dressing herself as she turned over a <lb/>new leaf, to her chamber-maid,
          “it is <lb/>time for repose; you may retire.” <persName>Susan</persName>
          <lb/>moved to the door; as she opened it, the <lb/>report of two guns discharged in quick
          <lb/>succession threw her whole frame into <lb/>agitation; she screamed aloud, and fled
          <lb/>unconsciously toward <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, <lb/>who was herself
          considerably startled. <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, nevertheless, was not
          <lb/>intimidated. Naturally of a courageous <lb/>disposition, she hastened to a window
          <lb/>of her apartment, and casting a look <lb/>abroad, to her utter astonishment beheld
          <lb/>the house where <persName>Rosa</persName> dwelt on fire. Feel- <lb break="no"/>ings
          of humanity, more than any peculiar <lb/>interest which she felt in the individual
          <lb/>fate of <persName>Rosa</persName>, created in <persName>Mrs. Charmion’s</persName>
          <lb/>breast the utmost anxiety for the safety <lb/>of the inhabitants of the burning
          house. <lb/>Her bell was rung with violence, and all <lb/>her domestics were speedily
          assembled. <lb/>Except her old faithful coachman and <lb/>chamber-maid they were, as is
          common in <pb/>
          <lb/><placeName>Maryland</placeName>, negroes. The black men were <lb/>instantly ordered
          to repair to the place <lb/>where the fire was raging, and render <lb/>every assistance in
          their power to extin- <lb break="no"/>guish it. <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> was
          respected <lb/>and esteemed by every one around her, <lb/>and the execution of her
          commands was <lb/>always a pleasure to her dependents. <lb/>They rapidly sped toward the
          place, <lb/>where, by this time, the fire was burn- <lb break="no"/>ing with the utmost
          fury. Each one took <lb/>his own road. A stout black fellow, noted <lb/>for his strength
          and intrepidity, in his <lb/>route to the scene of distress, found his <lb/>boldness
          considerably intimidated. He <lb/>had scarcely proceeded a hundred paces <lb/>from the
          house, when the report of ano- <lb break="no"/>ther gun arrested his attention, and look-
            <lb break="no"/>ing in the direction whence he saw the <lb/>flash, he perceived through
          the darkness <lb/>of the night, which was intense, a fla- <lb break="no"/>ming sword
          flourishing in the air, and in <lb/>about a minute afterwards the point de- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>scended to the ground, and appeared to <lb/>enter the earth to the extent
          of several <lb/>inches. Recovering from the check which <lb/>his ardour had received,
          thither the ne- <lb break="no"/>gro hastened, determined to ascertain <lb/>what was the
          cause of this singular ap- <lb break="no"/>pearance. When he had arrived within <lb/>about
          twenty feet of the place, the bla- <lb break="no"/>zing sword suddenly disappeared, and to
          <lb/>his astonishment, the black man found on <lb/>the spot a mattress on which lay a hu-
            <lb break="no"/>man creature, incessantly crying without <lb/>sobbing. Knowing the
          humane disposi- <lb break="no"/>tion of his mistress, the negro took up <lb/>the mattress
          with the person on it, <choice><sic>and and</sic><corr>and</corr></choice>
          <lb/>conveyed it home. What were the <lb/>sensations of surprise in <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName>, <lb/>may easily be conceived, when she be- <lb break="no"/>held in
          this afflicted creature that identi- <lb break="no"/>cal <persName>Rosa</persName>, whose
          image had so recently <lb/>occupied her thoughts. A bandage of <lb/>part of a silk
          handkerchief confined the <lb/>lips of <persName>Rosa</persName>, and had prevented her,
          in <pb/>
          <lb/>conjunction with her fears, from shriek- <lb break="no"/>ing. Her hands were secured
          behind her <lb/>with a large shawl, and her feet were tied <lb/>with a bandanna. The <seg

              style="font-style: italic">Durance</term>: forced confinement; constraint.</note>
          imposed <lb/>on the child, convinced <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>
          <lb/>that the occurrence of the fire was not <lb/>alone the cause of her being found in
          that <lb/>strange situation, an opinion which she <lb/>had at first been inclined to
          adopt. A <lb/>thousand conjectures rushed into her <lb/>mind before she had time to
          question <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName>; and the return of her servants, soon <lb/>after
          the girl had been conveyed into the <lb/>house, tended only the more to excite <lb/>her
          amazement. They brought intel- <lb break="no"/>ligence that the house was consumed <lb/>to
          the ground by the time they had ar- <lb break="no"/>rived at it, and that they had not
          seen a <lb/>single human being on or near the pre- <lb break="no"/>mises. As there was no
          contiguous build- <lb break="no"/>ing, and the few trees that were distri- <lb break="no"
          />buted around the place in clusters, were <lb/>not endangered by the fire, the negroes
          <lb/>had thought proper to return. </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> The philosophical temper of <persName>Mrs. <lb/>Charmion</persName> was not proof
          against the im- <lb break="no"/>patient desire of learning the true cause <lb/>of the
          violence exercised upon <persName>Rosa</persName>, <lb/>and of ascertaining the author of
          her ex- <lb break="no"/>posure and abandonment in the darkness <lb/>of the night. Soothing
          with gentle con- <lb break="no"/>dolence the sorrows of the child, she in- <lb break="no"
          />quired of her the reason why she was <lb/>thus treated? But this was rather more
          <lb/>than the girl could answer. All she knew <lb/>she told. She stated that she had
          return- <lb break="no"/>ed home after having disposed of her <lb/>nosegays, had related to
          her parents the <lb/>conversation between herself and <persName>Mrs.
            <lb/>Charmion</persName>, concerning which she had <lb/>been very closely questioned by
          them; <lb/>that a short time after nightfall she had <lb/>been seized by her father and
          bound, <lb/>in the manner in which <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>
          <lb/>had seen; that her mother had told her <lb/>if she remained quiet no harm would
          <lb/>happen to her, but that if she made the <pb/>
          <lb/>least noise she would be instantly killed; <lb/>that her father shortly after drew a
          mat- <lb break="no"/>tress from under one of his beds, placed <lb/>her upon it with the
          assistance of a stran- <lb break="no"/>ger who was at their house that evening, <lb/>took
          her to the spot where the negro found <lb/>her, placed the mattress with her upon it
          <lb/>on the ground; that some conversation <lb/>then took place between her father and
          <lb/>the stranger, at the termination of which <lb/>she heard the discharge of two guns;
          <lb/>after which there appeared to reign for a <lb/>considerable time a total silence; she
          then <lb/>heard the report of a third gun, and saw <lb/>something flaming in the air over
          her <lb/>head; as it descended to the earth she <lb/>was exceedingly terrified, as she
          appre- <lb break="no"/>hended it would destroy her; presently, <lb/>however, it totally
          disappeared, and she <lb/>found herself in the hands of a person, <lb/>who proved to be
          the negro belonging to <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>. This was the simple
          <lb/>story of <persName>Rosa</persName>. It was so singular a tale <pb/>
          <lb/>that it astonished <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, who <lb/>was led by her
          imagination into a thou- <lb break="no"/>sand various conceptions respecting this
          <lb/>curious adventure. There was no doubt <lb/>of the child’s having been found in the
          <lb/>open air in the manner she had descri- <lb break="no"/>bed, but might not the whole
          affair have <lb/>been a <seg xml:id="a034" corresp="#n034">profligate</seg><note

            debauched.</note> contrivance to force <lb/>the girl into the fostering care of
            <persName>Mrs. <lb/>Charmion</persName>? Could it be possible that her <lb/>parents were
          such savages as to abandon <lb/>their daughter to the equivocal charity <lb/>of the world,
          bound, and exposed to the <lb/>inclemency of the nocturnal atmosphere? <lb/>Was
            <persName>Rosa</persName> herself that artless child of na- <lb break="no"/>ture which
          the simplicity of her whole <lb/>appearance, and in particular, the can- <lb break="no"
          />did contour of her features, indicated her <lb/>to be? Might she not have combined
          <lb/>with her parents for some sinister pur- <lb break="no"/>pose, the first step to the
          attainment of <lb/>which might be to gain an admission into <lb/>the family of
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, under the <pb/>
          <lb/>character of a destitute orphan? Against <lb/>this latter suggestion the age of
            <persName>Rosa</persName> af- <lb break="no"/>forded, indeed, a reasonable argument;
          <lb/>but, nevertheless, there were many in- <lb break="no"/>stances on record of singular
          acuteness <lb/>in the practices of deception in per- <lb break="no"/>sons still younger.
          Such thoughts as <lb/>these were current in the mind of <persName>Mrs.
            <lb/>Charmion</persName> on the present occasion. She <lb/>pondered over them with
          discreet consi- <lb break="no"/>deration, for she was not hasty in form- <lb break="no"
          />ing an opinion from doubtful facts and <lb/>extraordinary appearances. </p>
        <p> The bias of <persName>Mrs. Charmion’s</persName> mind <lb/>was in favour of
            <persName>Rosa</persName>: but even admit- <lb break="no"/>ting the girl was devoid of
          duplicity, <lb/>there were objections to the extension <lb/>of patronage towards her which
          would <lb/>strongly weigh with a woman of prudence. <lb/>To foster her, would be in some
          degree <lb/>to adopt her. The adoption of a child <lb/>with whose history she was almost
          wholly <lb/>unacquainted, would be considered by <pb/>
          <lb/>the world as a singular circumstance; the <lb/>prying eye of curiosity and the wanton
          <lb/>tongue of scandal, would not be inactive <lb/>on the occasion. <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion’s</persName> repu- <lb break="no"/>tation for moral rectitude was very firmly
          <lb/>established, but that was not a sufficient <lb/>bulwark against the corrosions of
          suspi- <lb break="no"/>cion, which might be excited by the fa- <lb break="no"/>shionable
          as well as the unfashionable <lb/>vulgar. Some verification of <persName>Rosa’s</persName>
          story <lb/>would be required, besides the bare reci- <lb break="no"/>tal of <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName>. And what proof <lb/>had she to offer? None; except the evi- <lb
            break="no"/>dence of the negro; who, being a slave, <lb/>might reasonably be supposed to
          have <lb/>been bribed to tell any kind of a tale that <lb/>his mistress required him to
          relate. The <lb/>narrative of <persName>Rosa</persName> would be no conclu- <lb break="no"
          />sive evidence, because, being subject to <lb/>the influence of <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName>, she <lb/>might very naturally be thought entirely <lb/>under her
          control. The incidents con- <lb break="no"/>nected with the discovery of
                <choice><sic><persName>Rosa</persName> in the</sic>
            <pb/>
            <lb/><corr><persName>Rosa</persName> in her</corr></choice> exposed situation, would
          <lb/>serve more to bring the truth of the tale <lb/>in question than to confirm it; for
          al- <lb break="no"/>though firing of the gun was not of itself <lb/>a remarkable
          occurrence; yet, connected <lb/>with the strange account of a flaming <lb/>sword, and the
          apparently uncommon <lb/>cruelty exercised toward a feeble girl, it <lb/>served to give a
          marvellous complexion <lb/>to the whole affair. <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> could
          <lb/>not perceive that there was any necessary <lb/>connexion between the burning of the
          <lb/>house and the adventure of <persName>Rosa</persName>, nor did <lb/>the latter know of
          such an event till she <lb/>was informed of it at the house of her <lb/>kind receiver. If
            <persName>Rosa</persName> told the truth, or <lb/>was not deluded in the fact of her
          father <lb/>being near her when the gun was fired, <lb/>there was pretty clear evidence
          that he had <lb/>escaped destruction by the burning of the <lb/>house; and hence there was
          great room <lb/>to conclude the whole family had fled, <lb/>and that their departure from
          their resi- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>dence was premeditated before the fire <lb/>occurred. </p>
        <p> Facts and reflections of this nature <lb/>would infallibly have induced <persName>Mrs.
            Char- <lb break="no"/>mion</persName> to relinquish the personal care of
            <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName>, (although her humanity would have <lb/>been a sure
          guarantee that the girl would <lb/>have been provided for by being put as <lb/>an
          apprentice into some respectable and <lb/>worthy family,) had it not been for a
          <lb/>secret affection which lurked in her heart <lb/>for the child. </p>
        <p> It is a peculiar trait in human nature, <lb/>continually verified in practice, but ill
          de- <lb break="no"/>fined in theory, that <emph style="font­-style: italic">reason</emph>
          is a weakly <lb/>faculty when opposed to <emph style="font­-style: italic">feeling</emph>.
          By feel- <lb break="no"/>ing it is not meant to denominate <emph
            style="font­-style: italic">passion</emph>, <lb/>which is rather the <emph
            style="font­-style: italic">excess</emph> of feeling than <lb/>feeling itself. <emph
            style="font­-style: italic">All our good or bad habits <lb/>depend upon feeling.</emph>
          The drunkard in- <lb break="no"/>dulges in extravagant potations, because <lb/>he has
          acquired the feeling for that species <lb/>of gratification. He combats, generally, <pb/>
          <lb/>in vain, the propensity to drink, because <lb/>his sensations continually present to
          his <lb/>mind the idea of it until the feeling is sa- <lb break="no"/>tisfied. This is
          essentially the case with <lb/>every appetite of mankind; and if an in- <lb break="no"

          <lb/>practices, it is not so much by the power <lb/>of reason as by the operation of a
          vir- <lb break="no"/>tuous feeling more influential than that of <lb/>the evil one. Where
          the affection is in <lb/>its infancy, the impulses of reason may <lb/>subdue the
          excitations of feeling, and the <lb/>superficial observer may boast of the sa- <lb
            break="no"/>lutary ascendancy of a virtuous disposi- <lb break="no"/>tion; yet, when the
          vice has taken deep <lb/>root, it holds no parley with reason, but <lb/>prostrates the
          counsels and the maxims <lb/>of the latter with the force of a tropical <lb/>hurricane. It
          is curious to speculate up- <lb break="no"/>on this subject, and interesting and use- <lb
            break="no"/>ful to examine it thoroughly. Philoso- <lb break="no"/>phers may rely upon
          it, that <emph style="font­-style: italic">moral turpi- <lb break="no"/>tude is the result
            of physical defect</emph>, as cer- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>tainly as that madness is the result of a <lb/>disorganized brain. Is
          immorality, then, <lb/>incurable? Generally speaking, it is; and <lb/>vitious practices,
          and even crimes them- <lb break="no"/>selves, although the welfare of society
          <lb/>undeniably requires their punishment, are <lb/>more deserving of sympathetic regret
          than <lb/>of merciless invective. What do we behold <lb/>in drunkenness? A horrible vice,
          indeed; <lb/>but still a vice to which the frailty of our <lb/>nature renders us liable.
          What in theft? <lb/>What in murder? What in that dark <lb/>catalogue of public offences,
          for the com- <lb break="no"/>mission of which so many culprits are <lb/>brought to the bar
          of justice, and put to <lb/>their trial before God and their country? <lb/>Humiliating
          instances of depravity, truly; <lb/>but such as the most virtuous, the most <lb/>wise, may
          be betrayed into by some irre- <lb break="no"/>sistible propensity. </p>
        <p> But if, as in common, there be little <lb/>hope of cure for immoral habits after
          <lb/>they are formed, the means of prevention <pb/>

              >Authority of the parent ends too soon</term>: apparently a reference to the age of
            majority, the age at which a person can make property transactions and act independently
            of their parents. In English Common Law, the age of majority was for most purposes
            twenty-one, but it was frequently observed that the age of majority trended downward in
            the <placeName>British colonies</placeName> and <placeName>United States</placeName>.
            The age of majority often figured, too, as an index in regulations about apprenticeship
            and servitude.</note> and, with some excep- <lb break="no"/>tions, the parental rein is
          too carelessly <lb/>held, by both fathers and mothers, for the <lb/>benefit of their
          children and the welfare <lb/>of society. In proportion as the form of <lb/>a government
          tends towards democracy, <lb/>in the same proportion ought domestic <lb/>education to be
          circumspect and rigid. <lb/>What care is taken with the horse, and <pb/>
          <lb/>with the most insignificant animals, to de- <lb break="no"/>velope their excellences,
          and to cultivate <lb/>their usefulness, by curtailing their evil <lb/>propensities! But
          the offspring of man, <lb/>reputed the most estimable part of crea- <lb break="no"/>tion,
          is suffered to rush into the front <lb/>ranks of society, unconfirmed in maxims <lb/>of
          common prudence, like a new sponge <lb/>in a kennel, prepared to suck in every <lb/>foul
          pleasure; and like a sponge, too, lia- <lb break="no"/>ble to be squeezed and moulded into
          any <lb/>hideous shape by the cheating palm of <lb/>every passing knave. The discreet
          exer- <lb break="no"/>cise of parental duties is of more advan- <lb break="no"/>tage to
          society than a thousand laws en- <lb break="no"/>acted by as many
            <persName>Solomons</persName>. It makes <lb/>virtuous habits pleasing, by fortifying
          <lb/>reason with feeling, instead of arraying <lb/>the former against the latter; and
          gives <lb/>a tone to the mind which enables it to <lb/>surmount the most rigid duties of
          life, <lb/>without debasing the character by mean- <lb break="no"/>ness, or polluting the
          heart with crime. </p>

        <p> The affections of <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> were <lb/>strongly engaged in
          favour of <persName>Rosa</persName>, won <lb/>chiefly to her interest by a romantic
          <lb/>charm arising from the singular com- <lb break="no"/>plexion of her story; and those
          affections <lb/>finally triumphed over every scruple sug- <lb break="no"/>gested by
          prudence. The girl was put to <lb/>rest, the servants retired, and the thoughts <lb/>of
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> were employed, du- <lb break="no"/>ring the silence
          of the night, in devising a <lb/>systematic plan for the welfare of her <term
            style="font-style: italic">pro- <lb break="no"/>tegée</term>. She concluded to retain
          the child <lb/>under her roof, and trust to the strength <lb/>of her own character for
          justification in <lb/>the eyes of the world; but as much as <lb/>possible to prevent the
          innuendoes of ma- <lb break="no"/>licious tongues, she determined to send, <lb/>on the
          following morning after breakfast, <lb/>for a justice of the peace, and before <lb/>him
          make a formal and solemn declara- <lb break="no"/>tion of all the circumstances of the
          case, <lb/>and to support her recital by the affida- <lb break="no"/>vit of the
          chambermaid. Having come <pb/>
          <lb/>to this conclusion, she fell into a delight- <lb break="no"/>ful slumber, such as
          happy souls only can <lb/>enjoy, and to which the wicked are total <lb/>strangers. </p>
        <p> Early in the morning the old coachman <lb/>was stirring; and the slaves had collected
          <lb/>in the kitchen, preparatory to receiving <lb/>their breakfasts before they departed
          to <lb/>the performance of their respective tasks. <lb/>Whilst they were expressing their
          won- <lb break="no"/>der to one another, in their ignorant way, <lb/>at the strange events
          of the preceding <lb/>evening, a man of very uncouth appear- <lb break="no"/>ance entered,
          in a dress remarkably tat- <lb break="no"/>tered, and making a humble bow to all
          <lb/>present, very deliberately sat down on a <lb/>bench near a table, pulled out an ink-
          <lb/>horn from which he took a pen, dipped <lb/>it in the ink, spread paper before him,
          and <lb/>seemed prepared to write with great ear- <lb break="no"/>nestness. Giving himself
          a sudden turn, <lb/>however, he perked up his right eye in a <lb/>very consequential
          manner, and addressed <pb/>
          <lb/>the servants in a style perfectly inquisi- <lb break="no"/>torial. The slaves were
          all gaping with <lb/>wonder; the chambermaid, who had just <lb/>come into the kitchen,
          stared at the in- <lb break="no"/>truder with great vehemence; and the <lb/>coachman
          changed his quid of tobacco <lb/>from the right to the left side of his mouth. <lb/>“Pray
          my good people, (the inquirer thus <lb/>began,) can you tell me the <emph

          <lb/>let me put down a head piece, and I shall <lb/>be ready to receive your

          on the top of a blank fools- <lb break="no"/>cap sheet of paper, </p>

            <p> “Who lived in’t before ’twas burnt?” </p>

            <p>
              <emph style="font­-style: italic">Pop</emph>. Fire to the hay. </p>
            <p> While this conversation was going on, <lb/>the old coachman stood attentively eyeing
              <lb/>the scribe, and as <persName>Tom</persName> uttered his “<emph
                style="font­-style: italic">ha!</emph>” <lb/>exclaimed, “Come, come, you mister, I
              <lb/>’spect you know something ’bout this <lb/>matter; come, come.” </p>
            <p> “Me!” exclaimed the man, with a <lb/>gaze: “Pooh, pooh, you’re cracked. But,
              <lb/>you say, my honest black”— </p>
            <p> “Honest black, or honest white,” said <lb/>the coachman, making towards him, “I’ll
              <lb/>s’cure you till the lady of the house comes <lb/>down, and has a little talk with
              you. <persName>Tom</persName>, <lb/>lay hold of him.” It was in vain for the
              <lb/>scribe to resist; the coachman and <persName>Tom</persName>
              <lb/>had seized him, and he was fixed to the <lb/>place where he was seated. </p>
            <pb/>
            <p> “Gentlemen,” said the stranger, “I <lb/>address you as freemen and fellow-citi- <lb
                break="no"/>zens; you may depend upon it you are <lb/>violating the freedom of both
              tongue and <lb/>pen, and making yourselves liable to im- <lb break="no"/>peachment for
              high treason.” As his <lb/>hands were still loose, he secured his ink- <lb break="no"
              />stand and manuscript by putting them in <lb/>his pocket. </p>
            <p> “Who are you?” asked the coachman. </p>
            <p> “A <emph style="font­-style: italic">marcury</emph>” replied the man. </p>
            <p> “A marcury! Why, that’s doctor’s <lb/>stuff,” said <persName>Tom</persName>. </p>

        <p> The chambermaid, who had for some <lb/>time stood gazing at and listening to the
          <lb/>stranger, no sooner perceived that he was <lb/>seized by the coachman and negro
            <persName>Tom</persName>, <lb/>than she ran up stairs to <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName>, <lb/>whom she found dressed, and preparing <lb/>to descend from her
          chamber. </p>
        <p> When <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> had entered her <lb/>parlour, she ordered the
          man to be con- <lb break="no"/>ducted thither. In her presence, how- <lb break="no"/>ever,
          he was entirely mute, and would not <lb/>speak a single word, although he was pret- <lb
            break="no"/>ty forcibly urged to it by the old coach- <lb break="no"/>man. From his
          behaviour, and the in- <lb break="no"/>formation of the servants, <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName>
          <lb/>conceived there was good cause to suspect <lb/>him; and he still remaining stubborn,
          <lb/>she ordered him to be carried before a <lb/>justice of the peace in the neighbourhood
          <lb/>for examination. This was interesting em- <lb break="no"/>ployment for the coachman
          and <persName>Tom</persName>, and <pb/>
          <lb/>they hurried their prisoner away to the <lb/>’squire’s without the least delay. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Thomas Fist, esquire</persName>, was, perhaps, one <lb/>of the most singular

          are some very odd per- <lb break="no"/>sonages employed in the administration <lb/>of
          justice in small matters. Among these <lb/>oddities, <persName>Thomas Fist,
            esquire</persName>, was re- <lb break="no"/>markable. <persName>Fist</persName> was not
          his proper sur- <lb break="no"/>name, but a nickname which had grown <lb/>into familiar
          use, and to which he now <lb/>on all occasions readily answered: He de- <lb break="no"
          />rived it from the circumstance of his <lb/>signing his precepts somewhat after the
          <lb/>manner of the illustrious old English ba- <lb break="no"/>rons, by closing his hand
          into a fist, dipping <lb/>the nether end of it into a large open ink- <pb/>
          <lb/>pot, and then impressing it at the foot of <lb/>his warrants and other official acts.
          This, <lb/><persName>’Squire Fist</persName> thought, was a very ingenious <lb/>invention;
          for, to the mortification of all <lb/>the <persName>Fists</persName>, great and small,
          rich and poor, <lb/>it must be confessed that <persName>Thomas Fist,
            <lb/>esquire</persName>, could not write. At first the <lb/>’squire imagined himself to
          be the ori- <lb break="no"/>ginal inventor of this method of signing <lb/>an instrument of
          writing; but, happen- <lb break="no"/>ing to be at a neighbour’s house one day, <lb/>he
          heard one of the children, a boy about <lb/>eleven years old, say, “that a great
            <persName>French <lb/>king</persName> used to write his name just like <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Fist</persName>;” whereupon, inquiring into the affair, <lb/>and somebody jocosely
          telling him that <lb/>the said French king was <persName>Charlemagne</persName>, <lb/>our
          justice was consoled with the idea of <lb/>having followed so bright an example, and
          <lb/>from that moment congratulated himself <lb/>upon his being a very great and extraor-
            <lb break="no"/>dinary man, an inference which he drew <lb/>from the supposed
          circumstance of him- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>self and <persName>Charlemagne</persName>, without the least
          <lb/>knowledge of each other, having fallen <lb/>upon the same symbolic expedient. An- <lb
            break="no"/>other advantage, <persName>Mr. Fist</persName> boasted, be- <lb break="no"
          />longed to this mode of signing precepts, <lb/>which was, that it put all attempts to
          forge <lb/>his <emph style="font­-style: italic">hand-writing</emph> at defiance. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>’Squire Fist</persName>, in another sense, did not <lb/>belie his name. The mode
          in which he <lb/>had obtained his appointment was, by <lb/>threatening to beat any man who
          should <lb/>presume to hold the office of justice of <lb/>the peace in that vicinity to
          his exclusion; <lb/>so that it may be said, in the vulgar idiom, <lb/>that he <emph
            style="font­-style: italic">fisted</emph> himself into office. The first <lb/>act of
            <persName>Mr. Fist</persName>, in his official capacity, <lb/>was that of attending, in
          the absence of <lb/>the coroner, an inquest which was held <lb/>on the body of a person
          who had come to <lb/>his death by some unknown cause. The <lb/>form of the verdict
          returned on this oc- <lb break="no"/>casion, did immortal honour to <persName>Mr.
            Fist</persName>; <lb/>for so ingeniously did he cause it to be <pb/>
          <lb/>drawn up, that it was utterly impossible <lb/>for mortal man to tell, whether the
          jury <lb/>sat upon the corpse, or the corpse sat <lb/>upon the jury; and the instrument
          re- <lb break="no"/>mains to this very day in the office of <lb/>the clerk of
            <placeName>Baltimore county</placeName>, as a per- <lb break="no"/>fect model for all
          newly appointed justices <lb/>acting in similar cases. The fame of <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Fist</persName> immediately began to spread, and in <lb/>a short time he was
          overwhelmed with a <lb/>multiplicity of business. </p>
        <p> It was before <persName>Thomas Fist, esquire</persName>, <lb/>that the coachman and
          negro <persName>Tom</persName> con- <lb break="no"/>veyed their charge. When they arrived
          <lb/>at his office, early as it was, the justice <lb/>was already engaged in business. The
          <lb/>prisoner, who still remained mute, was, <lb/>of course, obliged to wait. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>’Squire Fist</persName> was employed in exa- <lb break="no"/>mining into the
          merits of a case which <lb/>seemed to require appearance-bail from <lb/>two offenders who
          had been brought be- <lb break="no"/>fore him for violating the public peace, <pb/>
          <lb/>by a brawl which they had occasioned at <lb/>a house of entertainment. A constable,
          <lb/>who chanced to be present, and was a <lb/>witness to the whole affair, had arrested
          <lb/>them on the spot. He was led to this <lb/>very rigid performance of his duty, chiefly
          <lb/>because he entertained considerable anti- <lb break="no"/>pathy against one of the
          culprits, who <lb/>was a courtier of his daughter, but <lb/>with the prospect of whose
          alliance the <lb/>constable was not much pleased, and by <lb/>disgracing him in the eyes
          of the neigh- <lb break="no"/>bourhood, hoped to compel him to leave <lb/>that part of the
          country. He kept the <lb/>two disturbers of the peace all the prece- <lb break="no"/>ding
          night in close custody, and had now <lb/>brought them before the magistrate to <lb/>be
          dealt with as the law directed. The <lb/>constable, knowing the curious disposi- <lb
            break="no"/>tion of <persName>Mr. Fist</persName>, was relating to him, in <lb/>a very
          precise manner, all the incidents <lb/>of the case; and, as the coachman and
            <lb/><persName>Tom</persName> entered, was just describing how <pb/>
          <lb/>one of the culprits, in a very provoking <lb/>manner, had seized the other by the
          nose; <lb/>“as if it were in <emph style="font­-style: italic">this manner</emph>” said
          the <lb/>constable, taking the nose of the ’squire, <lb/>in a very familiar, though
          friendly way, <lb/>between his thumb and finger. As fate <lb/>would have it, at the very
          instant the con- <lb break="no"/>stable had got the nose of <persName>Mr. Fist</persName>
          be- <lb break="no"/>tween his fleshy pincers, he was seized <lb/>with the cramp in that
          hand, and contra- <lb break="no"/>ry to his own inclination, his thumb and <lb/>finger
          were drawn together in such close <lb/>contact and in such a forcible manner, <lb/>that
          the nose of his worship received a <lb/>severe gripe, which was continued, on <lb/>account
          of the cramp, notwithstanding <lb/>the justice endeavoured to disengage <lb/>himself.
          “Pardon, pardon,” was roared <lb/>out by the constable; “cramp! cramp!” <lb/>Now, it so
          occurred to the ’squire, un- <lb break="no"/>fortunately for the constable, that this was
          <lb/>a mischievous trick in the peace-officer, <lb/>in order to revenge himself upon the <pb/>
          <lb/>justice for a past affront; and as the for- <lb break="no"/>mer roared out “cramp!”
          by way of <lb/>apology, a notion entered the head of <persName>Mr. <lb/>Fist</persName>
          that the word “cramp” was a kind <lb/>of cant phrase of exultation, the utterance <lb/>of
          which, in his opinion, added insult to <lb/>outrage. Rising from his seat, and pull- <lb
            break="no"/>ing back his head, the constable’s finger <lb/>and thumb still adhering to
          his nose, he <lb/>cried out with a nasal twang, occasioned <lb/>by the pressure upon his
          nostrils, “I’ll <lb/>cramp you,” and at one blow knocked <lb/>the constable down. </p>
        <p> The coachman and <persName>Tom</persName>, whilst this <lb/>was going on, had let go
          their prisoner; <lb/>and, attracted by the singularity of the <lb/>constable’s involuntary
          gripe of the jus- <lb break="no"/>tice’s most prominent feature, which to <lb/>them
          appeared designedly done, were <lb/>paying much more attention to the scene <lb/>before
          them than to the actual business <lb/>upon which they came thither. The pri- <lb
            break="no"/>soner, watchful for an opportunity, slip- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ped out of the door and made off. He was <lb/>gone too far, before they
          discovered his <lb/>elopement, to overtake him. They never- <lb break="no"/>theless went
          in pursuit of him; but, after <lb/>an hour’s fruitless search, were obliged <lb/>to return
          to <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> with the story <lb/>of his escape, and of what had
          taken place <lb/>at <persName>Mr. Fist’s</persName>. The persons in the cus- <lb
            break="no"/>tody of the constable, having no inclina- <lb break="no"/>tion for a legal
          prosecution, likewise ex- <lb break="no"/>onerated themselves from safe-keeping <lb/>and
          the necessity of giving bail, and <lb/>made off with the greatest speed, leaving <lb/>the
          justice to condole his nose for the in- <lb break="no"/>jury it had received from the
          offensive <lb/>gripe of his official, and more particularly <lb/>for the loss of a portion
          of the <seg xml:id="a039" corresp="#n039">cuticle</seg><note xml:id="n039" corresp="#a039"
              ><term style="font-style: italic">Cuticle</term>: a piece of skin.</note>
          <lb/>which had been pealed from it by the <lb/>sudden jerk in loosening the grasp of the
          <lb/>constable when he knocked him down. <lb/>The peace officer lay passively on the
          <lb/>floor for some time, unable, from the se- <lb break="no"/>verity of the blow, to
          recover himself. <pb/>
          <lb/>Report says, however, that the magis- <lb break="no"/>trate and his officer came
          afterwards to <lb/>a very good understanding, solemnly ra- <lb break="no"/>tifying a
          perpetual peace, as they had <lb/>often done before, when any thing inter- <lb break="no"
          />fered to disturb that harmony which their <lb/>respective interests required should sub-
            <lb break="no"/>sist between them. In point of reputa- <lb break="no"/>tion with the
          public, the constable was <lb/>in this affair a considerable gainer, for he <lb/>had been
          previously stigmatized as a most <lb/>notorious coward; but now, as every bo- <lb
            break="no"/>dy believed he had taken <persName>’Squire Fist</persName> by <lb/>the nose
          from the pure impulse of cou- <lb break="no"/>rage, and as <persName>Fist</persName> was a
          notorious bully, <lb/>fame trumpeted abroad the constable’s <lb/>prowess, insomuch that he
          became a <lb/>terror to man, woman and child, for <lb/>ten miles round the country. The
          name <lb/>by which he generally passed after this <lb/>encounter was that of the <emph

        <p> When <persName>Francis Figary</persName> made his escape <lb/>from negro

          Bust- <lb break="no"/>ling through the streets in a great hurry <lb/>and with a mysterious
          air, which was ob- <lb break="no"/>served by many persons who knew him <lb/>well and were
          acquainted with his voca- <lb break="no"/>tion, he entered the principal coffee-house, <pb/>
          <lb/>where a number of the citizens were as- <lb break="no"/>sembled to inquire the news
          of the day. <lb/><persName>Figary</persName> being accustomed to frequent that <lb/>place,
          made no scruple of asking for pen, <lb/>ink and paper; which he did for the purpose
          <lb/>of attracting attention, because he stood <lb/>in no need of these articles, inasmuch
          as <lb/>he had the materials for writing already <lb/>in his possession. The keeper of the
          cof- <lb break="no"/>fee-house, an obliging amiable man, com- <lb break="no"/>plied with
          his request, and <persName>Figary</persName> glan- <lb break="no"/>cing his eye around the
          room upon the <lb/>company with a very consequential air, <lb/>quivered the fingers of his
          right hand, <lb/>thrust up the coat sleeve of his right arm, <lb/>puckered up his mouth to
          a degree of <lb/>very wise consideration, and began to <lb/>scrawl at a prodigious rate,
          even now <lb/>and then muttering to himself, (but loud <lb/>enough to be heard,) the words
            “<term style="font-style: italic">fire</term>,” <lb/>“<term style="font-style: italic"
            >girl</term>,” “<term style="font-style: italic">constable</term>,” “<term

          which he had en- <lb break="no"/>countered at <persName>Mrs. Charmion’s</persName>, and at
          the <lb/>office of the justice of the peace. </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> By this time several persons, who had <lb/>remarked <persName>Figary’s</persName>
          motions in the streets, <lb/>and were agitated with a spirit of the <lb/>most invincible
          curiosity, were hurrying <lb/>to the coffee-house to learn the intelli- <lb break="no"
          />gence which the collector of news might <lb/>have in his possession. Several of them
          <lb/>entered the room where he was, impa- <lb break="no"/>tiently crying out, “<hi
            rend="italic">What news, <persName>Fig</persName>? <lb/>What news,
              <persName>Figary</persName>?</hi>” “News!” he ex- <lb break="no"/>claimed: “Gentlemen,
          I beg you would <lb/>not interrupt me.” He then went on in <lb/>his scribbling, with great
          earnestness and <lb/>gravity, muttering as he wrote; A-n-d—
          <lb/>fire—ne-gro—ga-i-rl—lady—jus-tice—c- <lb/>o-n—con-stab-le— nose.” He proceeded in
          <lb/>this manner, till those who stood observing <lb/>him became so excessively anxious
          for the <lb/>particulars, that they began to jostle and to <lb/>coax him: “<term
            style="font-style: italic">Dear <persName>Fig</persName>; <persName>Mr.

              Fugary</persName>, <lb/>dear;</term>” were heard in different parts of <lb/>the
          coffee-room at the same time. At <pb/>
          <lb/>length <persName>Figary</persName>, pushing the ink-stand <lb/>away from him, took up
          the paper on <lb/>which he had been scribbling, turned his <lb/>face towards the company
          who were now <lb/>on the very tiptoe of expectation, placed <lb/>his back against the
          desk, and gave every <lb/>usual indication of his being about to read <lb/>aloud; when
          suddenly eyeing the gentle- <lb break="no"/>men round, he assumed a sardonic grin,
          <lb/>snapped his teeth with energy; and, the <lb/>door being near, darted into the street,
          <lb/>and instantly disappeared. Those who <lb/>were acquainted with him, laughed im- <lb
            break="no"/>moderately; some thought he was mad; <lb/>many wondered what he would be at;
          <lb/>not a few sallied after him; and in the <lb/>course of an hour the whole city was in
          <lb/>an uproar concerning the important infor- <lb break="no"/>mation which was supposed
          to be in pos- <lb break="no"/>session of <persName>Mr. Francis Figary</persName>. Every
          <lb/>body was guessing. At one time it was <lb/>thought he had a clew to a <seg

            <lb break="no"/>ly, the only hope that was left was one <lb/>founded on the gazette, for
          which he was <lb/>known to be newsmonger. When that <lb/>should appear, it was confidently

            <lb break="no"/>sity could be gratified, it was very sagely <lb/>resolved to wait till
          the following day. </p>
        <p> The event did not altogether disap- <lb break="no"/>point the expectations of the

            <p> “We lament, with afflictive profun- <lb break="no"/>dity, that a superb mansion and
              dormitory <lb/>was ignited subsequent to the last descent <lb/>of Sol below the

              />nal darkness, equalled only by the density <lb/>of chaos. There being no reservoir
              of <lb/>aqueous particles adjunctive to the pre- <lb break="no"/>mises, the elegant
              tenement was reduced <lb/>by the energy of the vital flame to a state <lb/>of utter
              annihilation. A curious inquirer <lb/>into the natural or phenomenal causes of
              <lb/>this terrible catastrophe, has veritably as- <pb/>
              <lb break="no"/>certained that it was originated by an in- <lb break="no"/>flammation
              of a certain species of bestial <lb/>nutriment, vernacularly denominated <term

        <p> Thus far had <persName>Justice Ample</persName> proceeded <lb/>when he was interrupted
          by the arrival of <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion’s</persName> anxious acquaintances
          <lb/>(ladies and gentlemen) from the city. In- <lb break="no"/>quiries were eagerly made
          of her respect- <lb break="no"/>ing the fire, and at the sight of
            <persName>Rosa</persName> they <lb/>were vehemently though respectfully mul- <lb
            break="no"/>tiplied. <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> recited to them <pb/>
          <lb/>every incident of the adventure within <lb/>her knowledge; and then stated, more
          <lb/>particularly to <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, in whose <lb/>judgment she greatly
          confided, the busi- <lb break="no"/>ness in which <persName>Justice Ample</persName> was
          engaged. <lb/><persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> showed <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>
          the <lb/>paragraph in which she was alluded to; <lb/>having brought with him the newspaper
          <lb/>for that purpose. On perusing it, she <lb/>was sensibly affected, and observed that
          <lb/>she thought it absolutely necessary to <lb/>publish the deposition which was then
          <lb/>making, when it should be completed, <lb/>in the same newspaper, in order to clear
          <lb/>up the transaction. Against the execution <lb/>of such a
              <choice><sic>resoluton</sic><corr>resolution</corr></choice>
          <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> stre- <lb break="no"/>nuously persuaded her; and
          explained to <lb/>her, that such a proceeding would only <lb/>provoke further remarks from
          the jour- <lb break="no"/>nalist. “Because, madam,” said he, “the <lb/>journalist profits
          by the entertainment <lb/>which he affords to his readers, who pa- <lb break="no"/>tronise
          him in proportion to the amuse- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ment with which he furnishes them.— <lb/>Whenever he gets possession of an
          un- <lb break="no"/>common occurrence, he makes the most <lb/>of it; he garnishes it
          agreeably to his own <lb/>fancy, and prolongs the discussion of it <lb/>for as great a
          length of time as possible. <lb/>By attempting to confute his insinuations, <lb/>you will
          only fan the flame which lights <lb/>him into nature. What a charming mor- <lb break="no"

          journalist, be <lb/>converted into a proof of immorality: <lb/>He would impudently aver
          that your anxi- <lb break="no"/>ety to vindicate yourself was evidence of <lb/>your guilt,

            when <lb/>you treat him with contempt</emph>.” </p>
        <p> The reasoning of <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> was <lb/>too just to be disregarded by
            <persName>Mrs. Char- <lb break="no"/>mion</persName>. She even resolved not to proceed
          <lb/>in her deposition as she had originally <lb/>intended; reflecting, that if a life of
          vir- <lb break="no"/>tuous actions would not shield her from <lb/>the tongue of malice,
          there was no magic <lb/>in mere words that could effect her defence. <lb/>Accordingly, by
          way of dismissing <persName>Jus- <lb break="no"/>tice Ample</persName>, she remarked that
          she be- <lb break="no"/>lieved she would dispense with his fur- <lb break="no"/>ther good
          offices, and required to know <lb/>the amount of his demand? </p>
        <p> “Fifty dollars,” said he. </p>
        <p> “Fifty dollars!” repeated several of <lb/>the company, with surprise. </p>
        <p> “A very moderate sum, indeed,” re- <lb break="no"/>plied the justice; “for, you must
          know, <lb/>ladies and gentlemen, I have acted not as <pb/>
          <lb/>a simple justice in this business, but as <lb/>a law-justice; and, really, I value
          myself <lb/>not a little upon my refinement in law <lb/>learning; because, although, to be
          sure, <lb/>there be several of the profession who are <lb/>nearly equal to me, yet for

        <p> “Fifty pages, <persName>Mr. Ample</persName>! why, sir, <lb/>you have not yet written a
          single one,” <lb/>said <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>. </p>

          pages, at least, to <lb/>recite all the circumstances.” </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> “You are right, <persName>Mr. Justice</persName>,” observed <lb/><persName>Mr.
            Roaster</persName>, who was among the num- <lb break="no"/>ber of those who had hastened
          to visit <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> on seeing her name in <lb/>the newspaper;
          “I am of opinion, that, <lb/>had you continued in the same charming <lb/>style in which
          you have begun, it would <lb/>require five hundred pages to effect it.” </p>
        <p> “There, madam,” said <persName>Ample</persName>, “you <lb/>see the gentleman gives it
          against you.” </p>
        <p> “Do you think, <persName>Mr. Ample</persName>,” asked <lb/><persName>Mr.
            Derwent</persName>, “that you could support <lb/>and recover this claim of fifty dollars
          in a <lb/>court of justice?” </p>
        <p> “Do you ask my serious opinion,” <lb/>said the justice? </p>
        <p> “Certainly, sir.” </p>
        <p> “Then I will assure you that I could. <lb/>Do you imagine the lawyers will cry <lb/>down
          high fees? Pooh! they live by <lb/>them: and judges are lawyers; or, if you <lb/>please,
          lawyers are judges; and they have a <lb/>certain <emph style="font­-style: italic"
            >tendresse</emph> for the fraternity. The bar <pb/>
          <lb/>rule the judges, and the judges influence <lb/>the jury, and thus should I gain my
          cause. <lb/>The lawyers may hate <emph style="font­-style: italic">me</emph>, sir; but de-
            <lb break="no"/>pend upon it, <emph style="font­-style: italic">they’ll stick to the

        <p>
          <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> was strenuously ad- <lb break="no"/>vised by a majority
          of the company, not <lb/>to satisfy this rapacious demand; but she, <lb/>partly from a
          wish to get rid of him with- <lb break="no"/>out altercation, and partly from a chari- <lb
            break="no"/>table motive, (for the man was miserably <lb/>poor,) paid him fifty dollars,
          and took <lb/>a formal receipt for it. After writing an <lb/>acknowledgment for the
          payment of the <lb/>money, <persName>Justice Ample</persName> appeared to be <lb/>employed
          in writing something else, <lb/>which, having finished, he suddenly rose <lb/>from his
          chair, and reaching a piece of <lb/>paper to <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, he remarked
          that <lb/>there was a small billet for him. <persName>Mr. Der- <lb break="no"

        <p> “A very pretty bill, truly,” said <persName>Mr. <lb/>Derwent</persName>. </p>
        <p> “Very pretty, as you say,” answered <lb/><persName>Ample</persName>: “Don’t you think I
          write a neat <lb/>hand? The sum is small, too; only ten <lb/>dollars; but I’m liberal in
          my charges.” </p>
        <p> “Very liberal, indeed,” cried <persName>Mr. <lb/>Roaster</persName>: “you seem to pick a
          man’s <lb/>pocket with perfect freedom.” </p>
        <p> “Pick pockets, sir; do you know that <lb/>I can sue you for that assertion?” </p>
        <p> “O sir,” said <persName/>, sneeringly, <lb/>“I only mean by <term
            style="font-style: italic">intendment of law</term>.” </p>
        <p> “Well, well; that’s another thing. <lb/>The <term style="font-style: italic">intendment
            of the law</term> is as you say; <lb/>but, as I didn’t make the law, why, you <lb/>know
          I am not to blame.” </p>
        <p> “<persName>Mr. Ample</persName>,” observed <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, <lb/>“I
          have reflected on this curious bill, and <pb/>
          <lb/>will pay it; but remember I give the mo- <lb break="no"/>ney to you as a gratuity,
          because I believe <lb/>you are poor. I am confident that you are <lb/>yourself liable to a

          for your charging fees as a coun- <lb break="no"/>sellor whilst you are in the commission
          <lb/>of the peace, is totally incompatible with <lb/>the laws of the land. However, <emph

          dollars, and <lb/><persName>Ample</persName> departed. </p>
        <p> “And now, <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, and my <lb/>good friends all,” said
            <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, “I <lb/>have to inform you of a very unpleasant
          <lb/>occurrence in relation to myself.” Every <lb/>one listened with the utmost anxiety. </p>
        <p> “You must know,” he continued, <lb/>“that the youth <persName>Richard</persName>, whom
          you late- <lb break="no"/>ly saw at my house in the city, and of <lb/>whom I had become

            <head style="text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center; font-style:bold">“ESSAY ON THE
              ART OF THINKING.</head>
            <p> “When we look at the actions of men, <lb/>and observe how very inconsistent they
              <lb/>are, it would seem impossible to avoid <pb/>
              <lb/>the conclusion that mankind in general, <lb/>and particularly young persons, are
              hur- <lb break="no"/>ried along more by the first impulses, <lb/>or by the primitive
              fruit of their rational <lb/>senses, than they are regulated in their <lb/>conduct by
              a just consideration of the ob- <lb break="no"/>jects of their pursuit. This defect
              arises <lb/>from the want of a true knowledge of the <lb/><emph
                style="font­-style: italic">Mode of Thinking</emph>. May a young man <lb/>presume to
              offer a few observations upon <lb/>this subject? </p>
            <p> “To think, is to reflect; it is to call <lb/>up in succession before the perceptive
              <lb/>faculty the images which are deposited in <lb/>the faculty of memory, and which
              have <lb/>relation to the particular thing that is the <lb/>object of our thoughts. </p>
            <p> “Modes of thinking are regular, or <lb/>irregular; an irregular mode of thinking is
              <lb/>indicative of a confused mind; and a re- <lb break="no"/>gular mode of thinking
              is the sure proof <lb/>of a mind well organized. The irregular <lb/>mode of thinking
              subjects a man to a <pb/>
              <lb/>thousand blunders, as the confusion of <lb/>his accounts subjects him to a
              thousand <lb/>pecuniary mistakes. He may have in his <lb/>memory all the ideas
              necessary to the for- <lb break="no"/>mation of a correct opinion, but by an
              <lb/>irregular method of calling them up, a <lb/>person may be led into erroneous con-
                <lb break="no"/>clusions, and of course, into indiscreet <lb/>actions. The regular
              mode of thinking <lb/>includes a proper classification of ideas, <lb/>so that the one
              may excite the other, and <lb/>enable a man to bring under the review <lb/>of the
              perceptive faculty all the knowledge <lb/>that he is master of on any particular
              <lb/>subject. By the classification of ideas, a <lb/>man with a meagre memory is many
              times <lb/>enabled to decide with superior accuracy <lb/>to a person who abounds more
              in ideas <lb/>but whose mode of thinking is confused. </p>
            <p> “A man of genius and ability is too <lb/>frequently negligent in the classification
              <lb/>of his ideas; and hence, (a circumstance <lb/>which frequently occasions
              surprise,) a <pb/>
              <lb/>plodding person, whose mode of thinking <lb/>is <seg xml:id="a059"
                corresp="#n059">perspicacious,</seg><note xml:id="n059" corresp="#a059"><term
                  style="font-style: italic">Perspicacious</term>: discerning.</note> often
              overreaches him. <lb/>I speak in this case with reference to ideas <lb/>which may be
              termed practical, from their <lb/>having received the sanction of experience <lb/>as
              it relates to their utility; for it is very <lb/>certain that in theoretical, or
              speculative <lb/>ideas, the man of genius, though his <lb/>mode of thinking be
              confused, will have <lb/>the advantage of the man of scanty ideas, <lb/>however well
              arranged they may be; and <lb/>this arises from the peculiar characteristics <lb/>of
              genius, which is distinguished by viva- <lb break="no"/>city of imagination and
              velocity in the as- <lb break="no"/>sociation of images; and these are powers <lb/>to
              be derived from nature alone, which <lb/>no art can teach, nor can any industry at-
                <lb break="no"/>tain them; for it is not true, (however flat- <lb break="no"/>tering
              the conceit may be to the mass of <lb/>mankind,) that nature, in regard to intel- <lb
                break="no"/>lect, has <seg xml:id="a060" corresp="#n060">created all men

            <p> “To illustrate the subject of this brief <lb/>essay by example, it may be supposed
              <lb/>that a man is required to give his deli- <lb break="no"/>berate opinion of the
              merit of a particu- <lb break="no"/>lar novel; he will, on the question being
              <lb/>proposed to him, proceed by tacitly in- <lb break="no"/>quiring of himself, <term
                style="font-style: italic">What constitutes a <lb/>meritorious novel?</term> If he
              be competent to <lb/>decide on the question, he will find that <lb/>the legitimate
              object of a novel is <emph style="font­-style: italic">to incul- <lb break="no"/>cate
                moral virtue through the medium of <lb/>pleasing fiction:</emph> he then proceeds to
              in- <lb break="no"/>quire further, <term style="font-style: italic">Are the morals
                inculcated <lb/>by this novel pure; is the fiction pleasing?</term>
              <lb/>This question, as to morals, must be de- <lb break="no"/>termined by the chastity
              of the imagery, <lb/>by the discriminating observations which <lb/>are made in
              relation to the incidents, by <lb/>the countenance which is given to virtue, <lb/>by
              the contempt and detestation bestowed <lb/>upon vice: And, as to the fiction, it must <pb/>
              <lb/>be decided by the sprightliness of the <lb/>style, by the humour of the
              narrative, by <lb/>the wit of the story, and the novelty of <lb/>the plot. After
              having thought over these <lb/>points, and drawn his conclusions, a man <lb/>may
              decide; and if he has the requisite <lb/>ideas in his memory, calls them up and
              <lb/>applies them regularly, and keeps public <lb/>welfare and private happiness in
              view as <lb/>the criterion of his judgment, he will ne- <lb break="no"/>ver fail to
              make a just decision. </p>
            <p> “Few men are competent judges on <lb/>any one subject; none are qualified to
              <lb/>decide upon all. A wise man, when his <lb/>opinion is asked upon a topic, and on
              exa- <lb break="no"/>mination he finds that he has not the ne- <lb break="no"/>cessary
              ideas to enable him to form a true <lb/>one, will candidly declare his ignorance.
              <lb/>No person can deliver an opinion pro- <lb break="no"/>perly, who has not the
              necessary know- <lb break="no"/>ledge; and that knowledge is made up <lb/>of all the
              known ideas connected with the <lb/>question proposed. </p>
            <pb/>
            <p> “The regular mode of thinking exhi- <lb break="no"/>bited in this essay, may seem
              tedious; <lb/>but, in reality, it is only fatiguing to dull <lb/>minds; to a man of
              genius whose me- <lb break="no"/>mory abounds with knowledge well ar- <lb break="no"
              />ranged, to think and to decide are but <lb/>the operation of a very short space of
              <lb/>time. </p>
            <p> “These remarks are nothing more than <lb/>hints for an outline, which, if com- <lb
                break="no"/>pletely developed, would form a very in- <lb break="no"/>teresting
              volume.” </p>

          occasion of my <lb/>first acquaintance with <persName>Richard</persName>; since
          <lb/>which, he has written and read to me <lb/>various short essays, on different
          subjects, <lb/>some grave and others lively. Last even- <lb break="no"/>ing I received
          from him a letter with an <lb/>inclosure.” Here <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> took from

        <p> “<persName>Richard</persName>!” exclaimed one of the la- <lb break="no"/>dies: “Pray,
            <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, what is the <lb/>surname of the youth?” </p>
        <p> “Why,” replied <persName>Mr. Dement</persName>, “he <lb/>has always passed with me by
          the name <lb/>of <persName>Richard Richardson</persName>; and I think it a <lb/>singular
          thing, on reflection, that he should <lb/>have, in this instance, signed
            “<persName>Richard</persName>” <lb/>only. It is possible he may have assumed <lb/>the

            <p> “Some very ill-natured person, through <lb/>a certain museum in this city, having,
              un0- <lb break="no"/>der pretence of describing an unknown <lb/>animal, indulged in a
              train of very un- <lb break="no"/>courtly remarks, upon that excellent and <lb/>useful

              <lb/>to the public a justification of it, and a <lb/>calm defence against the attacks
              of its <lb/>malicious assailant. </p>
            <p> “It is true, the gossip is a biped: it is <lb/>also distinguished for its
              volubility. But, <lb/>then, these two qualities enable it, in the <lb/>first place, to
              associate with ladies and <lb/>gentlemen; and, in the second, to tra- <lb break="no"

              <lb/>you would disgrace? a hint is sufficient; <lb/>the gossip is immediately on the

              all, the usefulness of the <lb/>gossip to the politician exceeds the art <lb/>of
              calculation: does he wish to tarnish <lb/>the fame of a rival? a squint at a gossip
              <lb/>of experience is enough; the cry is set <lb/>afloat, it gathers strength in its
              progress, <lb/>and falls like a thunderbolt upon the head <lb/>of the person at whom
              the detraction is <lb/>aimed. Surely, with such qualifications, <lb/>with such
              extraordinary capacity for utility <lb/>in society, it is cruel to endeavour to les-
                <lb break="no"/>sen, by open defamation, or by ironical <pb/>
              <lb/>innuendoes, the reputation of the gossip. <lb/>How would the community ever come

                <persName>par- <lb break="no"/>son Boreum</persName> was uncommonly eloquent,

              very properly <lb/>announced it at every party to which it <lb/>was invited for six

              <lb/>one black gown and two white ones; that <lb/><persName>Miss Jumper</persName> was

              <lb/>peculiar watchfulness of the gossip? As <lb/>to the objections against the male
              of this <lb/>animal, they are hardly worthy of notice; <lb/>for it is manifest, that
              he must be a cruel <lb/>hearted man and no christian, that could <lb/>wish to deprive
              a virtuous community of <lb/>those brawls, squabbles, and bickerings, <lb/>which
              produce bufferings and duels, and <lb/>which are the chief source of their rational
              <lb/>recreation and most genuine felicity. It <lb/>is left for an enlightened people
              to decide, <lb/>whether the writer who so wantonly as- <lb break="no"/>sailed the

        <p> “A-he! he! A-he!” sniggered <persName>Mr. <lb/>Simperwell</persName>, who was the

        <p> “Ladies,” said <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, “as the <lb/>performance does not meet

        <p> “O sir! O sir!” exclaimed several <lb/>female voices at once, (excepting <persName>Mrs.

        <p> “Yes, about <persName>Richard</persName>; how was it?” <lb/>inquired <persName>Mrs.

        <p> Just as <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> was on the point <lb/>of proceeding in his

        <p> “O let’s have the whole story,” voci- <lb break="no"/>ferated these frisky damsels. </p>
        <p> “A story, ladies! fie; do you conceive <lb/>me to be capable of telling a <emph

          who, knowing the object <lb/>of their visit, was determined to evade <lb/>their inquiries. </p>
        <p> “O! no; not a <emph style="font­-style: italic">fib</emph>; but the girl, and <lb/>the

        <p> “There was a fire in my neighbour- <lb break="no"/>hood, last night,” replied
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>. </p>
        <p> “And the girl?”— </p>
        <p> “Bless me, what strange notions get <lb/>abroad,” exclaimed <persName>Mrs.

        <p> “Dear, dear! well, well, I told you so,” <lb/>said one of the old maids to the other:
          And <lb/>after sitting awhile and chatting in a very <lb/>noisy manner, they jumped up,
          flirted <lb/>round the room, turned over the leaves of
              <lb/><bibl><persName>Franklin’s</persName> Essays</bibl>, peeped into a medical

          <lb/>as he gallantly took an arm of each, that <lb/>he resembled
          <persName>Mars</persName>, supported by the <lb/>graces. <persName>Mr. Roaster</persName>
          remarked that any <lb/>body would have taken beau <persName>Botherum</persName>
          <lb/>for the god of war by the <emph style="font­-style: italic">roaring</emph> which

            <lb break="no"/>lighted with the beau’s compliment, were <lb/>giggling in great style.
          As they depart- <lb break="no"/>ed from the villa, one of them remarked <lb/>that she did
          not approve of the myste- <lb break="no"/>rious demeanour of <persName>Mrs.

          <lb/>seemed not to wish to tell all she knew; <lb/>“and, for my own part, sweet cherubim,”

        <p> “Not a whit!” said one of the old <lb/>maids. </p>
        <p> “A whit! No; not a straw! Would <lb/>you give ear to such a thing?” said the <lb/>other,

        <p> “What a comical, wicked fellow, you <lb/>are, <persName>Botherum</persName>,” said the
          other, tossing <lb/>her head as she ogled the beau. </p>
        <p> Away they hied to the city, where they <lb/>spread various reports concerning
            <persName>Mrs. <lb/>Charmion</persName>, and circulated a hundred wan- <lb break="no"
          />ton lies in order to defame her. But per- <lb break="no"/>sons of sense and character
          treated their <lb/>malice with contempt; and laughed most <lb/>heartily at their ignorant

          <lb break="no"/>perity, in the vocation which he had pre- <lb break="no"/>ferred. </p>

        <p>
          <persName>Mr. Robert Charmion</persName>, being a dealer <lb/>by retail, generally
          purchased his goods <lb/>at <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>. In his frequent visits to

          the daughter of <lb/><persName>Mr. Meshech Morvin</persName>, a merchant of <lb/>great
          enterprise, and who was extremely <lb/>successful in his commercial transactions.
          <lb/>Young <persName>Charmion</persName> was well established in <lb/>trade when his
          acquaintance with this <lb/>lady commenced, which happened in the <lb/>year <date

          whenever he went <lb/>to <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>; and to these hospitalities,
          <lb/>after <persName>Robert Charmion</persName> had once seen <persName>Do- <lb break="no"

        <p> A <emph style="font­-style: italic">miss in teens</emph> is generally a lively and

          man in a soil most <lb/>friendly to its growth, curls and entwines <lb/>itself in a

            <persName>Dorinda</persName>, for want of early restraint and <lb/>salutary correction,
          branch out into un- <lb break="no"/>pleasant exuberances and ungracious pas- <lb
            break="no"/>sions. She knew she was beautiful, and <lb/>she expected admiration; she
          felt her <lb/>natural mental superiority over other <lb/>young ladies, and she became
          domineer- <lb break="no"/>ing. Had her infancy been properly cul- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>tivated, and the powers of her mind been <lb/>systematically developed,
          she would have <lb/>learnt how much more amiable, and how <lb/>much more conducive to the
          happiness <lb/>of a woman it is, to exercise the empire <lb/>of the sex by the
          imperceptible influence <lb/>of gentle persuasion, than by the stern, <lb/>and rude, and
          boisterous authority of pre- <lb break="no"/>suming prerogative. </p>

        <p> Young <persName>Charmion</persName> was an interesting <lb/>figure; graceful and manly.
          His counte- <lb break="no"/>nance glowed with the ardour of high <lb/>health, softened by
          the spirit of benevo- <lb break="no"/>lence. Industrious, discreet, and affable, <lb/>he
          enjoyed the respect of the community <lb/>in which he resided, and was univer- <lb
            break="no"/>sally a favourite of the fair. In the rough <lb/>times in which his youth
          was cast, the <lb/>tuition of an ordinary schoolmaster, in <lb/>reading, writing, and
          arithmetic, was all <lb/>the instruction afforded to his juvenile <lb/>years: He had,
          however, considerably <lb/>improved himself by subsequent personal <pb/>
          <lb/>application to different branches of learn- <lb break="no"/>ing; and, generally
          speaking, was quali- <lb break="no"/>fied for social companionship, either with <lb/>men
          or women. </p>

        <p> No man, perhaps, could be better form- <lb break="no"/>ed to please
            <persName>Dorinda</persName> than <persName>Robert Char- <lb break="no"
          />mion</persName>. To his other excellent qualities may <lb/>be added firmness and mental
          stability, <lb/>which pleased without overawing the tem- <lb break="no"/>per of
            <persName>Miss Morvin</persName>. </p>

        <p> A year’s acquaintance, and a court- <lb break="no"/>ship of two months during that
          period, <lb/>was sufficient to unite in the bands of <lb/>wedlock, a pair so happily
          formed to <choice><sic>in-</sic>
            <lb/><corr>interest</corr></choice> and please each other. The match <lb/>was allowed to
          be, on all hands, a very <lb/>good one; with respect to the ages and <LB/>the situation of
          the parties, as well as to <LB/>the promotion of their temporal welfare: <LB/>and the
          autumn of the year <date when="1778">1778</date> was the <lb/>season in which
            <persName>Robert Charmion</persName> con- <lb break="no"/>veyed his lovely bride to
            <placeName>St. Leonard’s</placeName>, <lb/>in <placeName>Calvert county</placeName>,
          where he had previously <pb/>
          <lb/>prepared every thing in his power which <lb/>might afford her a pleasing and
          satisfactory <lb/>reception; and for some time they enjoy- <lb break="no"/>ed, without
          interruption, the happiness of <lb/>the connubial state, heightened by bright
          <lb/>prospects of the future, painted in the <lb/>gaudiest and most brilliant forms, by
          the <lb/>vividness of their imaginations. </p>
        <p> After the lapse of some months, the <lb/>novelty of a married state wore off; young
            <lb/><persName>Charmion</persName>, attentive to his business, grew <lb/>less particular
          and was less uniform in his <lb/>attentions to his wife; and, although he <lb/>esteemed
          and loved her as much as ever, <lb/>he concluded that the good sense of his <lb/>consort
          would cheerfully forego the more <lb/>minute and frivolous formalities of affec- <lb
            break="no"/>tion, if she were well assured that his <lb/>heart was, in reality,
          sincerely devoted <lb/>to her: He took every proper means to <lb/>convince her that it
          was; and that al- <lb break="no"/>though his love did not manifest itself in <lb/>so many
          romantic forms, it nevertheless <pb/>
          <lb/>was as loyal as it was originally, and that <lb/>the primal vivacity of the nuptial
          tie was <lb/>only yielding to a sentiment of a graver <lb/>tint, which, if not so
          enchanting would <lb/>certainly be more durable. </p>
        <p> But reasoning like this had little effect <lb/>upon <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>.
          “Am I not lovely?” <lb/>she would ask herself; “and whatever is <lb/>lovely is admirable:
          My father is rich; my <lb/>understanding is good; I am, therefore, re- <lb break="no"
          />spectable in my own person and by parent- <lb break="no"/>age; yet <persName>Mr.
            Charmion</persName> cools in his re- <lb break="no"/>gards; relaxes in his attentions,
          and takes <lb/>more delight in dull pursuits than in my <lb/>company. It is probable his
          heart pays <lb/>its devotions elsewhere, and I am neglect- <lb break="no"/>ed for some
          unworthy object.” Such was <lb/>the deluding logic of the passionate <persName>Do- <lb
              break="no"/>rinda</persName>. Discontent ripened into peevish- <lb break="no"/>ness,

          into a sullen moroseness, <lb/>which finally broke out into criminations.
            <lb/><persName>Robert Charmion</persName> was of a temper not <lb/>easily provoked; and
          all the inconsider- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ate invectives of his spouse had no other <lb/>effect upon him than to
          increase his in- <lb break="no"/>difference and inattention towards her. <lb/>Thus was a
          breach of domestic harmony <lb/>effected, which, by a more complacent <lb/>deportment and

          she played the <lb/><seg xml:id="a075" corresp="#n075">coquette,</seg><note xml:id="n075"

          <lb break="no"/>ness and perceiving the strength of his <lb/>attachment to his newly born
          infant tor- <lb break="no"/>mented him incessantly, believing that <lb/>she could at any
          moment, secure his ut- <lb break="no"/>most devotions through the attractions of
          <lb/>their interesting child. This conduct on <lb/>the part of <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName> was not the <lb/>result of disgust nor of animosity; but of
          <lb/>caprice, of false ideas of female impor- <lb break="no"/>tance in the matrimonial
          state, and of that <lb/>luxuriant wantonness of temper which <lb/>delights to tease, to
          perplex, and to agitate <lb/>the object of its holiest adoration. </p>
        <p> The firmness of <persName>Robert Charmion’s</persName>
          <lb/>mind was proof against the fickleness of <lb/>temporary capriciousness; but it could
          <lb/>not withstand the continual excitements <lb/>of the ever active and irregular temper
          <lb/>of his wife. To yield to her whims, to <lb/>gratify all her propensities, to dangle
          in <lb/>obsequious attention upon all her eccen- <lb break="no"/>tric movements, would be
          to sanction a <lb/>life of unpleasant servility, to destroy that <pb/>
          <lb/>equanimity in which he so much delighted, <lb/>to neglect his business, and thereby
          weak- <lb break="no"/>en the prospect of his future fortune. <lb/>On the other hand, to
          come to an open <lb/>rupture, to treat her with harshness, to <lb/>assume the tone, and
          the authority, and <lb/>to exercise the force of a connubial ty- <lb break="no"/>rant, was
          abhorrent to his soul, contrary <lb/>to all his notions of manly dignity, and <lb/>odious
          to that rational, endearing senti- <lb break="no"/>ment in regard to her, which still per-
            <lb break="no"/>vaded his heart, and was likely to en- <lb break="no"/>dure till death. </p>
        <p> His ingenuity, however, could devise <lb/>no scheme to restore domestic
              <choice><sic>tranquillity</sic><corr>tranquility</corr></choice>. <lb/>The rays of
          precious sunshine which it <lb/>was in the power of <persName>Dorinda</persName> to shed
          on <lb/>all around her whenever she pleased, <lb/>and which would have illuminated the
          <lb/>path of hymeneal felicity, too often ob- <lb break="no"/>scured by the vapours of
          sullenness and <lb/>spleen, were finally shrouded by an angry <lb/>and sluggish
          discontent, which gradually <pb/>
          <lb/>produced between them an external aver- <lb break="no"/>sion that eventually became
          manofest even <lb/>to strangers. This dislike was further <lb/>increased by the death of
          their daughter, <lb/>who sunk into the grave the first sum- <lb break="no"/>mer after her
          birth. </p>
        <p> Three years passed on in this uncom- <lb break="no"/>fortable manner, which period was
          not <lb/>productive of any amelioration of their <lb/>matrimonial state by the occurrence
          of a <lb/>single joyful incident of a domestic na- <lb break="no"/>ture, except the
          addition of a son and of <lb/>another daughter to the family of our pair. <lb/>These
          produced no permanent change in <lb/>the behaviour of <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>;
          and <lb/>so malignant had the misunderstanding <lb/>grown, that in the sequel it broke out
          <lb/>into open hostility and disgraceful alter- <lb break="no"/>cation. As an expedient
          for the promo- <lb break="no"/>tion of a more happy state of things, <lb/><persName>Mr.
            Charmion</persName> at last proposed that <persName>Do- <lb break="no"
          />rinda</persName>, with the children, should repair to <lb/>her father’s and reside there
          for a few <pb/>
          <lb/>months; in which time, being left to <lb/>calm reflection, he concluded that she
          <lb/>would become sensible of the imperfec- <lb break="no"/>tions of her disposition, and
          be convin- <lb break="no"/>ced, from a review of circumstances since <lb/>their marriage,
          that it was completely in <lb/>her power, by cherishing a conciliatory <lb/>disposition,
          which is so extremely com- <lb break="no"/>patible with feminine delicacy, to reunite
          <lb/>herself to him in the true spirit of matri- <lb break="no"/>monial love and
          friendship. </p>
        <p> Although the sensibility and the pride <lb/>of <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> were
          wounded by this <lb/>proposition, she nevertheless accepted it; <lb/>but she assented with
          a sternness and with <lb/>an emphasis which marked the rising <lb/>passion of her soul.
          The day was fixed <lb/>for her departure, and the hour was draw- <lb break="no"/>ing near. </p>

          <persName>Robert Charmion</persName> had among the de- <lb break="no"/>pendents of his

          himself <lb/>in the American army as a common sol- <lb break="no"/>dier. This Indian was
          in several severe <lb/>engagements which the troops of freedom <lb/>had with the English
          forces, in one of <lb/>which he was severely wounded, was con- <lb break="no"/>veyed to a
          military hospital, where he was <lb/>regularly attended by an army surgeon, <lb/>but was
          not for a long time restored com- <lb break="no"/>pletely to health. Being an invalid from
          <lb/>the wound, he found it too arduous a busi- <lb break="no"/>ness for his constitution
          to return to camp, <lb/>although the war was not concluded, and <pb/>
          <lb/>he longed exceedingly to partake fur- <lb break="no"/>ther in the combats which were
          still oc- <lb break="no"/>curring in various parts of the country; <lb/>but, yielding to
          necessity, he roved for <lb/>some time from town to town, until chance <lb/>threw him in
          the way of young <persName>Charmion</persName>, <lb/>who, admiring the romantic valour of
          the <lb/>Indian, took him to his dwelling, found <lb/>him employment, and administered to
          his <lb/>wants. The Indian had been christened <lb/><persName>Sol</persName>, from the
          circumstance of his parents <lb/>having claimed kindred with the race of <lb/>Incas, or
          children of the sun. </p>
        <p> A small family carriage, drawn by two <lb/>horses, was got in readiness, on the morn-
            <lb break="no"/>ing intended for <persName>Mrs. Charmion’s</persName> depar- <lb
            break="no"/>ture, to convey her and the children to her <lb/>father’s residence near
            <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>. The <lb/>lady was already seated in the carriage,
            <lb/><persName>Mr. Charmion</persName>was conveying his little <lb/>son towards it, and
            <persName>Sol</persName>, with the daugh- <lb break="no"/>ter in his arms, was
          deliberately making <lb/>for the vehicle, when a volley of musket- <pb/>
          <lb/>balls whistled on their ears, and <persName>Sol</persName>, look- <lb break="no"/>ing
          round, beheld <persName>Mr. Charmion</persName> wound- <lb break="no"/>ed and fallen to
          the earth, and his darling <lb/>boy apparently struggling with death for <lb/>existence.
          The coachman, who had taken <lb/>his seat as soon as <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>
          had <lb/>entered the carriage, was seized with a <lb/>universal trepidation, and his
          emotion <lb/>giving a sudden twitch to the reins, the <lb/>horses, already startled by the
          shower of <lb/>balls, galloped off in full speed on the road <lb/>leading to
            <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, the almost uncon- <lb break="no"/>scious driver simply
          retaining the reins in <lb/>his hands, without being able for one <lb/>whole hour to check
          the animals in their <lb/>furious career. </p>
        <p> The situation of <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> was <lb/>deplorable indeed; at the
          report of the <lb/>muskets she hastily looked through the <lb/>coach window, which was
          down, and saw <lb/>with affright her husband and helpless in- <lb break="no"/>fant prone
          on the earth. Every angry <lb/>sentiment, every feeling of pride vanished <pb/>
          <lb/>in an instant; and affection, sympathy, <lb/>anxiety, and every fond idea connected
          <lb/>with the connubial tie, rushed into her <lb/>mind tumultuously. In a <seg

          <lb/>convulsed sensibility, she endeavoured to <lb/>burst open the carriage door to aid
          her <lb/>husband and children; but <persName>Sol</persName>, hastening <lb/>to prevent
          her, pressed the door close, <lb/>shouted to the coachman to drive on, <lb/>(for which,
          however, there was no occa- <lb break="no"/>sion,) and <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>,
          distracted by <lb/>her feelings, her features distorted with <lb/>horror, shrieked aloud,
          and swooned away <lb/>as the carriage whirled along with the ut- <lb break="no"/>most

        <p>
          <persName>Sol</persName>, being an old soldier, and used to <lb/>scenes of this kind, soon

          com- <lb break="no"/>manded the party, readily granted quarter, <lb/>although he was

          <lb/>to the boats in waiting, a part of which <lb/>were immediately rowed off with the
          spoil <lb/>and prisoners. By this time the alarm <lb/>was spread, and the inhabitants of
          the <lb/>neighbourhood, seizing such arms as were <lb/>most convenient, hurried to the

          ascertain what had <lb/>become of his mistress. He found her just <lb/>recovering from her
          swoon, faint and lan- <lb break="no"/>guid: she hastily inquired of him the <lb/>fate of
          her husband and children. The <lb/>coachman could not tell. <persName>Mrs. Char- <lb
              break="no"/>mion</persName> remained fixed to her seat, her eyes <lb/>strained open
          with a vacant stare, her coun- <lb break="no"/>tenance portraying despair, her right
          <lb/>hand pressing her forehead with an open <lb/>palm, and her left on the window frame <pb/>
          <lb/>of the coach: A flood of tears came to <lb/>her relief, and served to recall her more
          <lb/>effectually to her senses. Such are the <lb/>operations of nature on the human
          senses, <lb/>in the moments of distraction. </p>
        <p> The coachman perceiving that he was <lb/>in a part of the country where he knew
            <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> was well acquainted, in- <lb break="no"/>quired
          of her whether he should drive up <lb/>to a house then in view. To this propo- <lb
            break="no"/>sal <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> consented, and the <lb/>coachman, who
          was not quite certain that <lb/>he was out of danger, made haste to the <lb/>dwelling in
          question. It belonged to a <lb/>substantial farmer, who was intimate with <lb/>her
          husband, and who paid every atten- <lb break="no"/>tion to her that he possibly could.
          Hav- <lb break="no"/>ing somewhat recovered the tone of her <lb/>mind, <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName> refused to proceed <lb/>a step further until she should learn some-
            <lb break="no"/>thing of the situation of her husband and <lb/>children. Indeed she had
          determined, on <lb/>reflection, to return instantly to <placeName>St. Leo- <pb/>
            <lb break="no"/>nard’s</placeName> to learn the particulars in person, <lb/>and would
          have actually proceeded thither <lb/>had not the farmer interfered, and in al- <lb
            break="no"/>most a peremptory manner prevented her. <lb/>The farmer, suspecting what was
          the truth <lb/>of the matter, equipped his two sons (one <lb/>of eighteen and the other of
          twenty years <lb/>of age) with horses and muskets, and <lb/>commanded them to ride hard
          for <placeName>St. Leo- <lb break="no"/>nard’s</placeName>, and to alarm the country in
          their <lb/>way. It was a good deal owing to the ar- <lb break="no"/>dour and courage of
          these two young <lb/>men that the British party was overtaken. <lb/>The following morning
          they returned to <lb/>their father’s house, and changed the op- <lb break="no"/>pressive
          anxiety of <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> into <lb/>the darkest melancholy with the
          mourn- <lb break="no"/>ful history of the captivity of her wounded <lb/>husband and of
          that of the faithful In- <lb break="no"/>dian and her daughter, as well as of the
          <lb/>death of her little son. The grief of <lb/>minds that are naturally strong is seldom

          <pb/>
          <lb/><choice><sic>deep</sic><corr>was deep</corr></choice> and corrosive; twenty-four

          and whistle <lb/>by her coach, she had suffered for an in- <lb break="no"/>stant an
          unworthy suspicion to enter her <lb/>mind; she thought it possible that her <lb/>husband
          had intended to destroy her. <lb/>The thought had even recurred to her on <lb/>recovering
          from her swoon. But now, <lb/>how much did she deplore his loss! How <lb/>many bitter
          regrets mingled with her <lb/>thoughts as she rapidly retraced the scenes <lb/>of her past
          hours! To the overwhelm- <lb break="no"/>ing calamities of the last terrible day,
          <lb/>what were all the previous ills of her life? <lb/>Reflection brought with it nothing
          but <lb/>self-reproaches; and after trying in vain <lb/>to compose herself to rest,
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>
          <pb/>
          <lb/>resolved to return to <placeName>St. Leonard’s</placeName>, to <lb/>attend to the
          burial of her child, and the <lb/>arrangement of the affairs of her ill-fated
          <lb/>husband. </p>
        <p> As she proceeded thither in her car- <lb break="no"/>riage, the gay visions of futurity
          cheered <lb/>her on the way. The angel of hope, so <lb/>deluding, yet so consoling to
          suffering <lb/>mortals, painted to her imagination the <lb/>probability of an early
          reunion with her <lb/>husband. She flattered herself that his <lb/>wound was not
          dangerous; that if it was, <lb/>he would be treated with humanity by <lb/>the English
          surgeons; that his trusty <lb/>Peruvian would attend him with fidelity; <lb/>and that her
          father, by applying to <persName>General <lb/>Washington</persName>, would soon be able to
          effect <lb/>his release. She enjoyed for a moment <lb/>this pleasing illusion; but as she
          entered <lb/>the town her gloom returned, and she <lb/>alighted at the place of her
          residence with <lb/>a <choice><sic>wo-worn</sic><corr>worn</corr></choice> bosom and an
          aching heart. <lb/>Her acquaintances crowded around her, <pb/>
          <lb/>glad to find she had escaped; for many <lb/>of them believed she had been taken cap-
            <lb break="no"/>tive with her husband. They tendered <lb/>her a thousand services, for
          which she <lb/>thanked them. Her son had been already <lb/>buried; and <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName>, after re- <lb break="no"/>maining a few days in a place where
          <lb/>every object only tended to excite her <lb/>tears, committed the superintendance of
          <lb/>her husband’s property to his father, and <lb/>repaired to her own paternal mansion
          in <lb/>the vicinity of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Mr. Morvin</persName> applied to <persName>General Wash- <lb break="no"
            />ington</persName> in behalf of the captive husband of <lb/>his unhappy daughter; and
          that illustrious <lb/>man took the necessary measures to pro- <lb break="no"/>cure his
          restoration: but, after a formal <lb/>inquiry, the British general informed him <lb/>that
          no such man as <persName>Robert Charmion</persName>
          <lb/>could be found among the number of <lb/>his prisoners. <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName> and her <lb/>father concluded that he was dead; and <lb/>this was
          also the opinion of old <persName>Mr. <pb/>
            <lb/>Charmion</persName>, who shortly afterwards de- <lb break="no"/>parted this life,
          leaving to his daughter- <lb/>in-law his whole estate in addition to that <lb/>of his son.
          It was many years before <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> obtained that equability
          <lb/>of mind which in the first part of this <lb/>volume we have represented her as enjoy-
            <lb break="no"/>ing; in the attainment of which she was <lb/>assisted by the sage
          admonitions of her <lb/>father, <persName>Mr. Morvin</persName>, who, in a ripe old age
          <lb/>sunk into the grave, and left her the sole <lb/>inheritrix of his fortune, including
          the <lb/>delightful villa where she afterwards <lb/>resided. </p>
        <p> The wound of <persName>Mr. Charmion</persName> was not <lb/>of itself mortal; but the
          agitation of his <lb/>mind, occasioned by this sudden separa- <lb break="no"/>tion from
          his wife, and his uncertainty <lb/>with respect to her fate, brought on a ra- <lb
            break="no"/>ging fever, which, notwithstanding the skill <lb/>and humane attention of
          the British sur- <lb break="no"/>geons, speedily produced a delirium, and <lb/>terminated
          in death. An hour before he <pb/>
          <lb/>expired, he charged <persName>Sol</persName> to guard and pre- <lb break="no"/>serve
          his daughter, and to take the first <lb/>opportunity of restoring her to her mo- <lb
            break="no"/>ther, if living; or, in the event of her <lb/>death, to her mother’s
          friends. </p>
        <p> Next to his hatred of the Europeans, <lb/>there was no passion or sentiment so
          <lb/>powerful in the heart of the Peruvian as <lb/>that of fidelity to a friend; and
            <persName>Sol</persName> pro- <lb break="no"/>mised the dying father strictly to obey
          <lb/>his commands. </p>
        <p> It was on his passage to <placeName>England</placeName>, with <lb/>a number of other
          prisoners, that <persName>Mr. <lb/>Robert Charmion</persName> died; and his remains
          <lb/>were committed to the waves according <lb/>to the custom of sailors. The Indian
          <lb/>arrived safely with the child in a British <lb/>port; and it being rumoured abroad
          that <lb/>there was a South-American among the <lb/>captives, he was sent for up to
            <placeName>London</placeName>, <lb/>whither he repaired with the daughter of <lb/>his
          deceased friend. There <persName>Sol</persName> procu- <lb break="no"/>red a nurse for the
          infant; having nou- <lb break="no"/>rished it on the passage with goat’s milk <pb/>
          <lb/>and other food adapted to its tender age, <lb/>which he procured from the captain of
          <lb/>the British transport vessel, who was a <lb/>very amiable man. </p>
        <p> The Peruvian’s arrival in <placeName>London</placeName> be- <lb break="no"/>ing much
          spoken of, the clergy, the law- <lb break="no"/>yers, and the natural and moral philoso-
            <lb break="no"/>phers became curious to see him, and <lb/>they concluded that this would
          be a fine <lb/>opportunity to decide the celebrated ques- <lb break="no"/>tion, <term
            style="font-style: italic">whether the natives of the American <lb/>continent are as
            acute and vigorous in their <lb/>intellect as the natives of
              <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and whe- <lb break="no"/>ther they are as susceptible
            of mental im- <lb break="no"/>provement?</term>
        </p>
        <p> Accordingly a committee was privately <lb/>selected, to examine and decide upon the
          <lb/>faculties of <persName>Sol</persName>. It consisted of a bishop, <lb/>a judge, and of
          two professors of philo- <lb break="no"/>sophy. Before this inquisition, the Peru- <lb
            break="no"/>vian was brought, where various ques- <lb break="no"/>tions were put to him,
          calculated to test, <lb/>by the answers he should give, the ex- <lb break="no"/>tent of
          his intellectual capacity. </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> The Indian soon perceived their mo- <lb break="no"/>tive and their object, and after
          having, <lb/>by the aptness of his replies to most of <lb/>their queries, shaken in the
          minds of his <lb/>examiners the doctrine of American in- <lb break="no"/>feriority,
            <persName>Sol</persName> surprised them still more <lb/>by the following series of
          observations; <lb/>for he was very well versed in the lead- <lb break="no"/>ing points of
          European literature, hav- <lb break="no"/>ing read many books whilst he resided <lb/>with
            <persName>Mr. Charmion</persName>, and having also pe- <lb break="no"/>rused several
          volumes whilst a soldier in <lb/>the army, immediately after he had ac- <lb break="no"
          />quired a sufficient knowledge of the En- <lb break="no"/>glish tongue. </p>
        <p> “I perceive,” said the Peruvian, ad- <lb break="no"/>dressing himself to his
          inquisitors, “that <lb/>you wish to ascertain the worth of my <lb/>mental qualifications,
          and through mine, <lb/>of those of my countrymen in general. To <lb/>save you much

            burned at the stake, and refusing to convert to Christianity, not wanting to encounter
            “accursed” Spaniards in the afterlife. During the Spanish conquest of
              <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, as recounted by <persName>Robertson</persName>, a group
            of young warriors threw themselves off a tower in an attempt to kill the Spanish

            associated with <placeName>Russia</placeName> and frequently cited as Old World
            “barbarians”; <persName>Robertson</persName> suggests the Tartars were the ancestors of

          />pose of precipitating <persName>Cortes</persName> from a tower, <lb/>you find the most
          fervent spirit of patriot- <lb break="no"/>ism. In the general resistance of the
          <lb/>Mexicans to the Spanish forces, you may <lb/>recognise the most undaunted courage. <pb/>
          <lb/>In the political institutions of <placeName>Peru</placeName>, are <lb/>to be found
          the principles of civilization <lb/>most precious to the human heart. In <lb/>what, then,
          is it that the native Ameri- <lb break="no"/>cans were defective? Is it because there
          <lb/>were some of them more savage than <lb/>others? Look at
          <placeName>Europe</placeName>! and you will <lb/>find it, even now, overrun with hordes
          <lb/>of Barbarians; with Tartars, and other <lb/>wandering tribes; whilst portions of it
          <lb/>are civilized in the highest degree <lb/>yet known. Is it because, when disco- <lb
            break="no"/>vered, the natives had no large vessels, <lb/>and were totally unacquainted
          with the <lb/>art of distant navigation? How long was <lb/><placeName>Europe</placeName>
          itself in that condition! <placeName>Greece</placeName>
          <lb/>had flourished and fallen, <placeName>Rome</placeName> had tri- <lb break="no"

          of <placeName>Asia</placeName>, and of <lb/><placeName>Africa</placeName>, still sneaked
          along the shore, nor <lb/>dared to adventure into the immense <lb/>ocean. Is it in the
          imbecility of <persName>Monte- <lb break="no"/>zuma</persName>, or in the dissensions of
          the Inca <pb/>
          <lb/>race? At what epoch has <placeName>Europe</placeName> been <lb/>free from the stain
          of monarchs who are <lb/>feeble in mind, and of princes who are <lb/>prone to discord? Is
          it in the ferocious <lb/>sacrifice of human victims in the reli- <lb break="no"/>gious
          ceremonies of the aborigines of <lb/><placeName>America</placeName>, that you trace their
          paucity of <lb/>mind? Did not the Greeks for a long <lb/>time perform the same rites? and
            <placeName>Eu- <lb break="no"/>rope</placeName> admires the Greeks. Besides, what
          <lb/>substantial difference is there between a <lb/>sacrifice of human beings on the altar
          of <lb/>the gods, and a sacrifice of human life on <lb/>the field of battle by the sword?
          The <lb/>first is done by a priest, the other by a <lb/>soldier; and the former is the
          most ex- <lb break="no"/>cusable in the eye of reason, for his offer- <lb break="no"/>ing
          is the evidence of a respect for the <lb/>deity, which thinks nothing too sacred <lb/>to

          <lb/>Europeans were when they were of the <lb/>same age.” </p>
        <p> At the conclusion of this speech the <lb/>Peruvian’s inquisitors were confounded.
          <lb/>They dismissed him with handsome pre- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>sents in money, averring that if he was a <lb/>true specimen of American
          intellect, the <lb/>value of the human mind in that quarter <lb/>had been very much
          underrated. </p>
        <p> This examination being made public, <lb/><persName>Sol</persName> was sought after by
          persons of fashion <lb/>and fortune in every direction; and a <lb/>widow lady who had no
          children, and was <lb/>very rich, adopted the daughter of <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Charmion</persName>, purely because her history was <lb/>in some degree connected
          with that of the <lb/>Peruvian; and from that moment <persName>Miss
            <lb/>Charmion</persName> was destined to be spoiled by <lb/>an English education. The
          Indian, whilst <lb/>he was in <placeName>England</placeName>, read an account in the
              <lb/><bibl><placeName>London</placeName> Gazette</bibl> of the adventure of the
          <lb/>British soldier at <placeName>St. Leonard’s</placeName>, wherein <lb/>it was stated,
          and <persName>Sol</persName> believed it, that <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> was
          killed at the same <lb/>time that her husband was wounded. </p>
        <p> The Peruvian remained in <placeName>London</placeName> till <lb/>the conclusion of
          peace. During his stay <lb/>there he became acquainted with several <lb/>English
          merchants, who very much ad- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>mired his sagacity, and in the year <date when="1783">1783</date>,
          <lb/>after his liberation, gave him five thou- <lb break="no"/>sand pounds sterling for
          managing a ship- <lb break="no"/>ment of British goods which they made <lb/>to
            <placeName>Lima</placeName> through Spanish ports. On his <lb/>arrival in
            <placeName>South America</placeName>, <persName>Sol</persName> married an <lb/>Indian
          woman who was in affluent cir- <lb break="no"/>cumstances, by whom he was blessed with
          <lb/>several fine children, who were very hand- <lb break="no"/>some and very delicate.
          For the daugh- <lb break="no"/>ter of <persName>Mr. Charmion</persName>, he thought he had
          <lb/>well provided by leaving her in the care <lb/>of the English lady, who had promised
          <lb/>to settle at her death the whole of her <lb/>fortune upon <persName>Miss
            Charmion</persName>; nor did he <lb/>believe he was at all disobeying in this
          <lb/>alienation, the dying request of his master <lb/>and friend, for as <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName> was an- <lb break="no"/>nounced to be dead, it would be hardly

        <p>
          <persName>Richard Orvaine</persName> was the true name of <lb/>the boy: he was descended

              style="font-style: italic">Probity</term>: integrity.</note>
          <lb/>and industry had become distinguished <lb/>and opulent. That branch of the family
          <lb/>of which <persName>Richard</persName> was immediately a <lb/>member, had fallen
          somewhat into decay; <lb/>for his father, not practising that economy <lb/>which had been
          the source of his ances- <lb break="no"/>tors’ wealth, had expended his fortune
          <lb/>during his life-time, leaving his worldly <lb/>accounts to be closed by his executors
          or <lb/>administrators, and committing his wife <lb/>and children to the precarious
          benevolence <pb/>

          <lb/>of an oscillating world. </p>
        <p> Nature had endowed <persName>Richard</persName> with ge- <lb break="no"/>nius, a gift
          which, connected with poverty, <lb/>commonly renders its possessor unhappy <lb/>and
          unfortunate through life. Genius is <lb/>bold, it is witty, satirical, sarcastic, proud,
          <lb/>aspiring, impetuous, and usually accom- <lb break="no"/>panied by the most unbounded
          sensibility. <lb/>Whoever is acquainted with the world, its <lb/>prejudices, and its
          passions, will be sensi- <lb break="no"/>ble how very difficult it is for genius, thus
          <lb/>characterized, to combat with the obsta- <lb break="no"/>cles which at every step

          patronise it at all, demand the <lb/>perfume of its odour, and claim its adora- <lb
            break="no"/>tions, as their natural revenue. But this <pb/>
          <lb/>is a species of subserviency which genius <lb/>cannot brook: like a high spirited
          horse, <lb/>wild, and disdaining the curb, it spurns <lb/>such <seg xml:id="a095"

          in- <lb break="no"/>fluence that that of a superior intellect. It <lb/>is from these
          peculiarities that genius has <lb/>acquired the reputation of instability; and <lb/>from
          which dulness takes occasion to <lb/>boast of higher merit in relation to the
          <lb/>necessary aptitude and qualifications for <lb/>avocations of a formal and
          systematical <lb/>nature. But it is a fallacy to aver that <lb/>genius is too volatile and
          eccentric for <lb/>serious business; for it is only indolence, <lb/>which is the source of
          many vices, that <lb/>naturally incapacitates a man for an occu- <lb break="no"/>pation
          which requires regularity and as- <lb break="no"/>siduous application. It has
          unaccountably <lb/>grown into a maxim, that genius and dis- <lb break="no"/>cretion are
          incompatible; and this is a <lb/>whim which vapid minds have magnified <lb/>for the
          purpose of adding to their own <lb/>importance in society. We meet every <pb/>

            <persName>Richard</persName> was so fortunate as to <lb/>become the favourite of a
          merchant, who <lb/>had known his family in better times; <lb/>and being taken under his
          protection, he <lb/>devoted all his spare hours, to the culti- <lb break="no"/>vation of
          his mind and the accumulation <lb/>of knowledge; he soon acquired the ha- <lb break="no"
          />bit of committing his thoughts to paper, <lb/>and, after some time, furnished the prints
          <lb/>of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> with an occasional essay, <lb/>which, being
          written with due consider- <lb break="no"/>ation, were usually well received. It <lb/>was
          this practice which was the cause of <lb/>our youth’s being introduced to the ac- <lb
            break="no"/>quaintance of <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>. </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> In general <persName>Richard</persName> was a very prudent <lb/>boy; and he had
          naturally no disposition <lb/>for vice. But his pursuits necessarily <lb/>brought him
          acquainted with several <lb/>youth of his own age, who were not <lb/>over-scrupulous or
          nice in their morals. <lb/>By accidental associations with these,
            <lb/><persName>Richard</persName> had frequently been drawn into <lb/>improprieties
          which, on reflection, exci- <lb break="no"/>ted regret. He had resolved by degrees <lb/>to
          separate himself from their society; but, <lb/>on the evening before he left
            <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, <lb/>he had been drawn into a circle of these
          <lb/>youngsters, who, in addition to their ur- <lb break="no"/>ging and in a manner
          compelling him to <lb/>drink freely, insisted upon his playing at <lb/>cards. To this, in
          an unguarded hour, <lb/>he acceded; and with a most unwarrant- <lb break="no"/>able
          license staked and lost a considerable <lb/>sum of money which was the property of
          <lb/>the merchant with whom he lived. Late <lb/>in the night, at the conclusion of his
          gam- <lb break="no"/>bling, he became perfectly sensible of his <pb/>
          <lb/>error, and loudly <seg xml:id="a097" corresp="#n097">execrated</seg><note

          qualified to give him advice; <lb/>but with that presumption for which in- <lb break="no"
          />temperate boys are so remarkable, unani- <lb break="no"/>mously advised him to leave the
          city, ex- <lb break="no"/>citing him to do so, by suggesting to him <lb/>various romantic
          ideas in relation to the <lb/>probable good fortune with which he >lb/might meet. Filled
          with shame and dread- <lb break="no"/>ing to encounter the merchant, in a weak
          <lb/>moment, instead of going to his friend <lb/>and candidly avowing his fault,
          soliciting <lb/>forgiveness, and promising reform, he <lb/>accepted the advice of his
          associates, who <lb/>made up twenty dollars on the spot to de- <lb break="no"/>fray his
          expenses to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, where <lb/><persName>Richard</persName>
          hoped to find temporary employ- <lb break="no"/>ment, or casual relief, in point of funds,
          <lb/>which might enable him to proceed to <lb/><placeName>Boston</placeName>. In that town
          resided <persName>Mr. Fair- <lb break="no"/>long</persName>, the friend of his father, who

          of his sudden flight, <lb/>declaring his intention to make him atone- <lb break="no"/>ment
          at the first moment he should have <lb/>it in his power. He confessed to his mo- <lb
            break="no"/>ther, his malconduct, implored her par- <lb break="no"/>don, and promised to
          let her hear from <lb break="no"/>him often, which, in the sequel, he did <lb/>not fail to
          do. To his family his going <pb/>
          <lb/>off occasioned the most bitter heart-ache; <lb/>and to the merchant the most sincere
          af- <lb break="no"/>fliction: but he was gone too far to be <lb/>overtaken; and although
          they would will- <lb break="no"/>ingly have retrieved him, they did not <lb/>know in what
          precise direction to pursue <lb/>him. </p>
        <p> When the youth arrived at <placeName>Easton</placeName>, he <lb/>concluded to walk
          across the country to <lb/><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. Having taken some refresh-
            <lb break="no"/>ment, he pursued his way, stopping no <lb/>longer than was absolutely
          necessary to <lb/>refresh himself with food and rest, until <lb/>he arrived at
            <placeName>Georgetown</placeName>, in the state of <lb/><placeName>Delaware</placeName>.
          It was about ten o’clock in <lb/>the day when he reached that place, where <lb/>he found a
          concourse of persons attend- <lb break="no"/>ing the county court which was then sit- <lb
            break="no"/>ting in the town. <persName>Richard’s</persName> thoughts were <lb/>sad and
          sorrowful, and he was turning to <lb/>go from the court-house in search of an <lb/>inn,
          when his attention was attracted by <lb/>an old man who had perched himself <pb/>
          <lb/>upon the tail of a cart, and began to <lb/>harangue the suitors who were loitering
          <lb/>about or near the court-house door. Our <lb/>young adventurer forgot, for an instant,
          <lb/>his want of refreshment, and listened <lb/>attentively to the old man, who, in a very

        <p> At the conclusion of this singular ha- <lb break="no"/>rangue, the old man descended
          from the <lb/>cart, amidst the shouts of some, and the <lb/>hisses of others of his
          auditors. One <pb/>
          <lb/>swore that he ought to be hanged, an- <lb break="no"/>other affirmed that he ought to
          be elected <lb/>a member of the assembly, and most of <lb/>them wondered who he was. Upon
          in- <lb break="no"/>quiry, it was ascertained that the orator <lb/>was an old
          schoolmaster, who had long <lb/>taught reading, writing and arithmetic, in <lb/>a little
          village in that county. It seems <lb/>the old gentleman had felt the effects of <lb/>the
          dissolute habits of the people there- <lb break="no"/>abouts, many of whom had not been
          very <lb/>punctual in paying him for the tuition <lb/>of their children; and he conceived
          this <lb/>a good opportunity to give them a lecture <lb/>on their idle practices and
          improvident <lb/>dispositions. </p>
        <p> The melancholy thoughts of <persName>Richard</persName>, <lb/>although they were
          somewhat diverted <lb/>by this scene, still prevented the natural <lb/>vivacity of his
          temper from gaining the <lb/>ascendant, as usual in his heart. He re- <lb break="no"
          />flected with severity upon his error; he <lb/>regretted the situation he had left in
            <placeName>Balti- <pb/>
            <lb break="no"/>more</placeName>, and even felt unhappy that he was se- <lb break="no"
          />parated from his youthful companions, <lb/>whose pernicious advice he had follow- <lb
            break="no"/>ed with so much facility. Wearied by <lb/>the recurrence of unpleasant
          ideas, he re- <lb break="no"/>paired to an inn, where he took some re- <lb break="no"
          />freshment, and secured lodgings for the <lb/>night; having in the evening procured
          <lb/>an early supper, he retired to lest. As <lb/>soon as his host was stirring in the
          morn- <lb break="no"/>ing, <persName>Richard</persName> arose, paid his bill, and
          <lb/>pursued his route towards <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. </p>
        <p> Nothing particular occurred further in the <lb/>history of this young man, until he
          <lb/>reached <seg xml:id="a101" corresp="#n101"

          thither <lb/>he had stopped several times, and, when <lb/>a town or village did not offer
          for re- <lb break="no"/>freshing himself, he had recourse to coun- <lb break="no"/>try

        <p> The sun had already set, when <persName>Richard</persName>
          <lb/>entered an inn at <placeName>Newcastle</placeName>, inquiring <lb/>for the
          accommodation of a bed and <lb/>a light repast. The landlord informed <lb/>him that he
          could be gratified, and <lb/>in the mean time showed him into <lb/>the supper room, where
          several persons <lb/>were sitting, engaged in sociable chat, <lb/>and waiting for the
          arrival of the usual <lb/>eating hour. <persName>Richard</persName> seated himself in
          <lb/>a chair close by a man of middling age, <lb/>who had a <seg xml:id="a103"

          the youth was pretty much of a no- <lb break="no"/>vice, this person by degrees drew him
          <lb/>into conversation. After a few minutes <lb/>of vague questions, remarks and rejoin-
            <lb break="no"/>ders between them, “Pray my dear young <lb/>friend,” said the man to

              “<choice><sic>what</sic><corr>What</corr></choice>
          <lb/>do you prefer for supper?” “Generally,” <lb/>said the young man, “a few dishes of tea

          <lb/>my appetite.” “Tea! my dear friend, <lb/>you’ll ruin your constitution!” replied the
          <lb/>stranger, in a half whisper, “let me ad- <lb break="no"/>vise you; you are new in the
          world: I <lb/>counsel you against tea. Poor <persName>aunt <lb/>Betty</persName>! would

          <persName>Richard</persName>, unskilled in <lb/>the low tricks of men, took all this in
          good <lb/>part; and, notwithstanding he thought <lb/>the stranger’s admonitions somewhat
          of- <lb break="no"/>ficious, yet his remarks concerning the <lb/>unwholesomeness of tea,
          corresponding <lb/>with what he had repeatedly heard from <lb/>many respectable persons of

          <lb/>man for his kind caution, and remarked, <lb/>that if he knew of a good substitute,
          <lb/>he believed he would quit drinking tea. <pb/>
          <lb/>“Know of a substitute! bless your <lb/>soul!” said the stranger with earnestness,

          elevated his head, so that the <lb/>light of the candles then burning in the <lb/>room
          shone full upon it, and gave a <lb/>glistening aspect to the rubies of his <lb/>nose,
          which <persName>Richard</persName> observing, asked <lb/>with something of an arch look,
          whe- <lb break="no"/>ther indulging in wine gave him the <lb/>high red flush which
          appeared to over- <lb break="no"/>spread his face? “Doubtless,” answered <lb/>the

        <p> “And nothing so sharp as a <placeName>York- <lb break="no"/>shire</placeName> bite,”
          observed a man of about <lb/>forty years of age, who sat in a corner of <lb/>the room,

          <lb/>glasses to <persName>Richard’s</persName> one, was too much <lb/>pleased with his
          thrifty bargain of a <lb/><placeName>Yorkshire</placeName> club, to leave off drinking in
          <lb/>a hurry. </p>
        <p> “The vine, I believe, is not a native <lb/>of <placeName>Madeira</placeName>,” said
            <persName>Richard</persName>: “it was car- <lb break="no"/>ried thither from
            <placeName>Sicily</placeName>.” </p>
        <p> “You are right,” remarked the <seg xml:id="a109" corresp="#n109">toper,</seg><note

          <lb/>hereabouts.” </p>
        <p> “<emph style="font­-style: italic">That’s a jemmy!</emph>” cried the dwarf. </p>
        <p> “Ah! <persName>Moses Macaroone</persName>; that’s one <lb/>of your silly gibes,” said
          the toper: “but <lb/>nobody minds you. Come, my young <lb/>friend, you don’t pledge me.” </p>
        <p> “You have been pledged so often <lb/>that you are past all redemption,’ retorted
            <lb/><persName>Moses</persName>. </p>
        <p> “<emph style="font­-style: italic">That’s a jemmy!</emph>” roared the dwarf. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Richard</persName> swallowed a glass-full of wine, <lb/>and became loquacious. </p>
        <p> The toper, with very little assistance <lb/>from the inexperienced youth, had emp- <lb
            break="no"/>tied the first bottle of wine and called <lb/>for a second. </p>
        <p> “Come, my dear fellow, let’s see the <lb/>bottom of it,” said the thirsty blade, (ele-
            <lb break="no"/>vating his voice,) as he addressed the <lb/>youth, and tilled up their
          glasses. </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> “When you get to the bottom,” ob- <lb break="no"/>served the quizzer, “you will see as
          <lb/>clearly as an owl in the sun-shine.” </p>
        <p> “<emph style="font­-style: italic">That’s a jemmy!</emph>” vociferated his
          <lb/>attendant. </p>
        <p> “I shall certainly die a martyr to the <lb/>love of wine,” continued the toper,
          <lb/>gulping down another draught of the <lb/>liquor, without paying any attention to
          <lb/>the remark of <persName>Moses</persName>. </p>
        <p> “You will not be the first victim to the <lb/>influence of a foreign incendiary,” said
            <lb/><persName>Macaroone</persName>. </p>
        <p> “<emph style="font­-style: italic">That’s a jemmy!</emph>” cried his ap- <lb break="no"
          />plauder. </p>
        <p> “Confound the thing!” exclaimed a <lb/>travelling Quaker gentleman, who had <lb/>stopped
          at the inn, but arriving after the <lb/>usual hour of supper, was gratifying him- <lb
            break="no"/>self with a hot beef-steak; “Confound <lb/>the thing!” he exclaimed, “I have
          real- <lb break="no"/>ly inflamed my finger.” </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> “Friend, thou art not the first, that <lb/>hath been <emph style="font­-style: italic"
            >burnt</emph> at a <emph style="font­-style: italic">steak</emph> for canvassing <lb/>a
          subject too zealously,” remarked <persName>Mo- <lb break="no"/>ses</persName>, quaintly
          imitating the style of the <lb/>Friend. </p>
        <p> “<emph style="font­-style: italic">That’s a jemmy!</emph> cried his trumpet- <lb

        <p> “Nor thou the first,” replied the Qua- <lb break="no"/>ker with mildness, “that hath

        <p> “<emph style="font­-style: italic">That’s a jemmy!</emph>” vociferated the <lb/>dwarf. </p>
        <p> “Is it so, <seg xml:id="a111" corresp="#n111"><persName>master

          <lb/>said <persName>Macaroone</persName>, getting angry. </p>
        <p> “The dwarf was a personage not <lb/>more than four feet in height, and had a
          <lb/>frightful nasal organ, which cast over a <lb/>very grotesque visage a most ludicrous

          sharp retort of <pb/>
          <lb/>the Friend, seized the unfortunate squire <lb/>by this enormous snout, and wrung it
          <lb/>with great severity. Enraged at this treat- <lb break="no"/>ment, the little fellow
          snivelled with vexa- <lb break="no"/>tion. “This is the treatment I get for <lb/>praising
          your infernal dull sayings; but <lb/>may I starve if I’ll ever <emph
            style="font­-style: italic">jemmy</emph> you again.” </p>
        <p> “You deserve it all, friend,” said the <lb/>Quaker, “for being a parasite.” </p>
        <p> “I was no parasite, good <persName>Mr. Broad- <lb break="no"/>brim</persName>,” replied
          the dwarf. “It was a <lb/>fair bargain between us. He gave me <lb/>substantial food and
          clothing, and I paid <lb/>him with the music of my tongue, a bet- <lb break="no"/>ter
          bargain than most flatterers make.” </p>
        <p> “<emph style="font­-style: italic">A pair o’sight</emph>” cried
            <persName>Moses</persName>, try- <lb break="no"/>ing to pun to the last, but enraged;
          “no, <lb/>no, not a <emph style="font­-style: italic">pair</emph>; I’ll seal up one of
          your <lb/>peepers;” and thus saying, he gave him <lb/>a blow on one eye, which swelled and
          <lb/>blackened it prodigiously. Several of <lb/>the company interfered, and prevented
          <lb/>the squabble from increasing. The dwarf <pb/>
          <lb/>ran off, swearing he would have his satis- <lb break="no"/>faction in law; and
            <persName>Moses Macaroone</persName> de- <lb break="no"/>parted also, muttering a
          malediction upon <lb/>the whole sect of Friends. </p>
        <p> The toper had been too intent upon <lb/>his wine to pay much attention to what <lb/>was
          going on; and <persName>Richard</persName>, overcome <lb/>with the strength of the liquor,
          sunk back <lb/>in the chair on which he sat, in a state of <lb/>complete inebriation. The
          Quaker very <lb/>humanely went to the landlord and re- <lb break="no"/>presented to him
          the situation of the <lb/>youth, recommending him to put the boy <lb/>to bed; and did not
          fail to hint to him the <lb/>impropriety of permitting the toper to en- <lb break="no"
          />snare the inexperienced lad into such a <lb/>state of intemperance. </p>
        <p> “Who pays?” demanded the land- <lb break="no"/>lord, bustling into the supper room, and
          <lb/>making towards <persName>Richard</persName> and his com- <lb break="no"/>panion. </p>
        <p> “Pays,” repeated the toper, more than <lb/>half drunk; “why, we pay, to be sure; <pb/>
          <lb/>come let’s see what my little friend has <lb/>got;” and he was about to thrust his
          <lb/>hand into <persName>Richard’s</persName> pocket, in order to <lb/>seize what money he
          had. </p>
        <p> But the Quaker who observed, pre- <lb break="no"/>vented him from effecting it. The
          land- <lb break="no"/>lord, (who, it seems was in connivance <lb/>with this drinking
          fellow,) finding the <lb/>Friend too vigilant, remarked, in a surly <lb/>tone, that he
          would take the boy to bed, <lb/>and the reckoning could be settled in <lb/>the morning.
          The rest of the company <lb/>that had supped in the room, had retired <lb/>to rest
          immediately after <persName>Macaroone</persName> and <lb/>his man left the tavern; and the
          Quaker, <lb/>after he was certain the youth was safely <lb/>lodged for the night, and had
          seen the <lb/>old toper reel out of doors, retired to his <lb/>chamber. </p>
        <p> When <persName>Richard</persName> awoke in the morning, <lb/>his sensations were not
          very enviable. <lb/>He was ashamed, confounded, and re- <lb break="no"/>proached himself
          with indiscretion. But <pb/>
          <lb/>the season of youth is not often the season <lb/>of protracted grief. He consoled his
          <lb/>misconduct with the thought that this <lb/>was only <emph style="font­-style: italic"
            >one</emph> offence against decorum; <lb/>and that as it had occurred in a place
          <lb/>where he was little known, the report of <lb/>it could not injure his future
          reputation. <lb/>Having tranquillized his mind with such <lb/>reflexions, and his frame
          being relaxed <lb/>by intoxication, he again sunk into a gen- <lb break="no"/>tle and
          refreshing slumber, which lasted <lb/>from the rising of the sun until the time <lb/>of
          breakfast. Whilst he slumbered, he <lb/>dreamed that he saw a young man, bloom- <lb
            break="no"/>ing and innocent in his appearance, stand- <lb break="no"/>ing near the open
          portals of an immense <lb/>garden, in which were beautiful beds of <lb/>gay and fragrant
          flowers; and bowers, <lb/>and arbours, and recesses, and running <lb/>streams, and
          bubbling fountains; and <lb/>the intersecting paths were strewed with <lb/>pinks and
          roses, and scented with a <lb/>thousand inviting perfumes. The young <pb/>
          <lb/>man stood, looking on with a wistful eye, <lb/>desirous of entering; but the price
          was <lb/>more than he could afford to pay. The <lb/>genius of the garden appeared to step
          up <lb/>to him, and exciting his desire by en- <lb break="no"/>larging on the beauties of
          the scene, told <lb/>him that he could enter, if he would <lb/>suffer a small black line
          to be drawn across <lb/>his forehead, and might amuse himself <lb/>for one quarter of an
          hour. So ardently <lb/>did he long to gain admittance, that he <lb/>submitted to the mark,
          although he was <lb/>conscious that it would stigmatize him. <lb/>Having entered, and
          strolled through the <lb/>garden for some time, he was enchanted <lb/>to the highest
          degree, and as the quarter <lb/>of an hour was about to expire, he felt a <lb/>most
          uncontrollable inclination to remain <lb/>for a longer period; but the laws of the
          <lb/>garden were <seg xml:id="a112" corresp="#n112">inexorable,</seg><note xml:id="n112"
            corresp="#a112"><term style="font-style: italic">Inexorable</term>: unyielding.</note>
          and he was com- <lb break="no"/>pelled to retire. The genius of the garden <lb/>addressed
          him again, and proposed ad- <lb break="no"/>mitting him for another quarter of an <pb/>
          <lb/>hour, provided he would submit to an- <lb break="no"/>other mark. The youth, all on
          fire to re- <lb break="no"/>new enjoyments for which he had now a <lb/>greater relish,
          yielded to the suggestions <lb/>of the genius, and sauntered through the <lb/>avenues
          again, reposing for a minute or <lb/>two in an arbour; and, still unsatisfied,
          <lb/>returned at the end of the time assigned. <lb/>As he approached from the garden, a
          <lb/>sage and venerable personage came up <lb/>to the youth and admonished him to re- <lb
            break="no"/>linquish the scene, and no more to permit <lb/>himself to be marked,
          inasmuch as it <lb/>would eventually disfigure his whole <lb/>countenance. But the youth,
          disregard- <lb break="no"/>ing this advice, repeated his visits to the <lb/>garden, until
          his features were completely <lb/>scored with black marks from his fore- <lb break="no"
          />head to his chin. Being thus marked, <lb/>he was finally refused further admission to
          <lb/>the garden, and <persName>Richard</persName> thought he <lb/>perceived him steal
          slily away to a com- <lb break="no"/>pany of hideous wretches, blackened like <pb/>
          <lb/>himself, and at whom were pointing as <lb/>they passed, the fingers of persons whose
          <lb/>visages were still pure and undarkened. <lb/>While this youth was pursuing his en-
            <lb break="no"/>joyments in the garden, and was renew- <lb break="no"/>ing them,
            <persName>Richard</persName> perceived in his dream, <lb/>various persons also entering
          and leaving <lb/>the garden, some paying, some submitting <lb/>to be marked, and others,
          when their <lb/>money was expended, seemingly per- <lb break="no"/>plexed, whether to
          continue in their en- <lb break="no"/>joyment of the place at the price of the <lb/>mark,
          or to abandon it altogether. </p>
        <p> Such was the dream of <persName>Richard</persName>; he <lb/>finally awoke, and found the
          Quaker <lb/>gentleman standing by his bed-side, jog- <lb break="no"/>ging him to rise. At
          first he was some- <lb break="no"/>what startled at seeing a stranger stand- <lb
            break="no"/>ing by him; but instantly recovering <lb/>himself, he arose; and whilst he
          was <lb/>dressing, the Quaker recapitulated to him <lb/>his indiscretion of the preceding
          night, <lb/>and warned him against a similar impru- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>dence in future. <persName>Richard</persName> had a good <lb/>heart, and a
          moderate, rational temper: <lb/>he took the Friend’s caution in good part, <lb/>and
          related to him, in return, in a brief <lb/>way what he had dreamed. “In thy <lb/>dream, my
          young friend,” said the Qua- <lb break="no"/>ker, “there is a useful lesson for thee.
          <lb/>The garden was that of Pleasure, the <lb/>genius was that of Vice, and the youth
          <lb/>thou sawest was Inexperience in a state <lb/>of poverty: the pleasures of the garden
          <lb/>were of too high a price for his fortune, <lb/>and he resorted to a mode suggested by
          <lb/>vice, in order to effect the gratification <lb/>of his desire: thou sawest the end he
          <lb/>came to: it was that of the wicked. <lb/>Such also was the fate of the more afflu-
            <lb break="no"/>ent, who eagerly rushed into the garden <lb/>of Pleasure. The sage whom
          thou per- <lb break="no"/>ceivedst admonish the youth of his dan- <lb break="no"/>ger, was
          the Minister of Morality. But <lb/>he followed not his counsel, and was de- <lb break="no"
          />stroyed. Be thou more circumspect.” <pb/>
          <lb/>Here the Quaker bade him adieu, and <lb/>took his departure, telling
            <persName>Richard</persName> that <lb/>he lived in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>,
          and if he went <lb/>that way he should be glad to see him: <lb/>at the same time he gave
          him his ad- <lb break="no"/>dress. </p>
        <p> As our young adventurer descended <lb/>the stairs to the breakfast-room, the Qua- <lb
            break="no"/>ker mounted his horse and rode off. The <lb/>greater part of the company had
          already <lb/>breakfasted, and when <persName>Richard</persName> sat down <lb/>to eat,
          there was no one to keep him <lb/>company but a man in a travelling dress, <lb/>of rather
          a genteel appearance, and of a <lb/>mild and serious aspect. The youth was <lb/>not
          displeased to find that he was not to <lb/>encounter the eyes of a crowded table, <lb/>for
          in truth he was fairly ashamed when <lb/>he reflected upon the intemperance of <lb/>which
          he had been guilty. A slight re- <lb break="no"/>past satisfied
            <persName>Richard</persName>; and when he had <lb/>finished, he demanded his bill of the
          land- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>lord. The host was not tedious in pro- <lb break="no"/>ducing his account,
          and the boy had the <lb/>mortification to find that the charges, oc- <lb break="no"
          />casioned by his frolic with the old toper, <lb/>exceeded the amount of his funds. Un-
            <lb break="no"/>pleasant as the circumstance was, he <lb/>stated the fact to the host,
          who, far from <lb/>excusing him from paying the balance, <lb/>reproached him with his
          inebriety, and in <lb/>a loud tone, threatened to resort to a legal <lb/>process to obtain
          his full demand. The <lb/>person who had breakfasted with <persName>Richard</persName>,
          <lb/>overheard this threat, and advancing to <lb/>the landlord, inquired how much the ba-
            <lb break="no"/>lance was. On learning that it was only <lb/>six shillings, he said,
          “make yourself <lb/>easy, young man, I will discharge it.” <lb/>The youth was instantly
          struck with sen- <lb break="no"/>sations of gratitude; and the landlord, <lb/>finding that
          he should get his money, <lb/>put on a more pleasant look. </p>
        <p> Matters being thus settled, <persName>Richard’s</persName>
          <lb/>new friend entered into conversation with <pb/>
          <lb/>him, and, by degrees drew from the <lb/>youth his whole history, with an avowal
          <lb/>of his intention of walking to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. <lb/>“It would be
          a pity,” said the man, <lb/>“to suffer you to walk thither: I will <lb/>defray your
          expenses myself;” and, with <lb/>a pious ejaculation, he exclaimed, “Hea- <lb break="no"
          />ven will reward me for befriending so <lb/>extraordinary a boy.”
            <persName>Richard</persName> felt him- <lb break="no"/>self flattered as well as
          obliged; and he <lb/>thought he had met with an angel. As <lb/>soon as the stage arrived
          from <placeName>French- <lb break="no"/>town</placeName>, our travellers embarked on board
          <lb/>the packet for <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>; and going <lb/>with wind and
          tide, arrived at that place <lb/>in a few hours. <persName>Richard</persName> and his com-
            <lb break="no"/>panion repaired to a decent house of en- <lb break="no"/>tertainment in

          <lb/>into the bargain. That <persName>Scratchaway</persName> is <lb/>an apostate to his

          <lb/>already, and with God’s blessing I hope <lb/>to belong to as many more before I die.
          <lb/>But I am no turncoat, Sir. I scorn to <lb/>desert my colours: I stuck to them all,
          <lb/>Sir, till they went out of fashion, or <lb/>while they stuck to me. Sir, I eat by
          <lb/>party, I drink by party, and I sleep by <pb/>
          <lb/>party; and, therefore, Sir, a party must <lb/>not be affronted.”
            <persName>Richard’s</persName> companion <lb/>was about to make a remark by way of
          <lb/>condolence to the landlord, when the <lb/>latter was called off to attend to an order
          <lb/>from the landlady; and his two remaining <lb/>guests, requesting a light, retired to
          rest. <lb/>The next morning, on inspecting one of <lb/>the daily gazettes just from the
          press, <lb/><persName>Richard</persName> perceived that the landlord had <lb/>caused a
          paragraph to be published, an- <lb break="no"/>nouncing that <persName>Mr.
            Scratchaway’s</persName> having <lb/>been at his house the preceding evening, <lb/>was
          quite accidental; and that the party, <lb/>if it would condescend to continue to
          <lb/>honour his inn with its meetings, would <lb/>not again be incommoded with such of-
            <lb break="no"/>fensive company. By this seasonable <lb/>apology, the innkeeper secured
          the for- <lb break="no"/>giveness of his friends, who again re- <lb break="no"/>sorted to
          his house as before. </p>
        <p> After breakfast our two travellers <lb/>walked forth to view the city; and every <pb/>
          <lb/>where beheld with involuntary admiration <lb/>the rising grandeur of this flourishing
          <lb/>emporium of the arts, of manufactures, <lb/>and commerce. After having gratified
          <lb/>their curiosity, they were bending their <lb/>steps homewards, when their attention
          <lb/>was arrested by a collection of people <lb/>at the corner of an obscure alley. On
          <lb/>coming up to the place, they found two <lb/>men who pretended to be employed in

          <lb/>of them held up a white handkerchief <lb/>before the congregation, whilst the other
          <lb/>was engaged in blowing coal dust into <lb/>their visual organs. “Good people,”
          <lb/>cried the one who held the handkerchief, <lb/>“look here: how do you see now? don’t

          <lb/>“Very black, indeed,” cried out several <lb/>voices. “Aye, aye;” replied the man,
          <lb/>“I told you the handkerchief was black.” <lb/>In the mean time these two <emph

          up, which <lb/>dispersed the coal dust, and the specta- <lb break="no"/>tors began to
          perceive they had been im- <lb break="no"/>posed upon. At that very instant an

          <persName>Richard</persName> and his companion now re- <lb break="no"/>turned to their

          man addressed <persName>Richard</persName>
          <lb/>in the following manner: “Young man, <lb/>I have a great regard for you, and I will
          <lb/>make your fortune if you will follow my <pb/>

          there any dishonesty in this; for <lb/>consider, it has been our misfortune to <lb/>have
          been born into the world after <lb/>the land had been got possession of by <lb/>others, so
          that we are deprived of our <lb/>share which we should otherwise have <lb/>inherited from
          nature. Besides, these <lb/>banks are the property of wealthy associ- <lb break="no"
          />ations, who can afford to lose the money. <lb/>They make profit out of the communi- <lb
            break="no"/>ty, and why should we not make profit <lb/>out of them?” At this harangue,
            <persName>Richard</persName>
          <lb/>was thunderstruck. His heart was still <lb/>the seat of honour; and although he had
          <lb/>erred in his conduct at <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, prin- <lb break="no"
          />ciples of the most unshaken integrity <lb/>kept full possession of his mind. Un- <lb
            break="no"/>skilled in the practical policy of human <pb/>

          knaves, but having read a <lb/>great deal, and reflected much mere upon <lb/>the
          philosophy of human institutions, it <lb/>was impossible to delude him by any
          <lb/>proposition tending to the corruption of <lb/>society, which had for its basis the
          sub- <lb break="no"/>version of the fundamental doctrines of <lb/>moral order. After a
          considerable pause, <lb/>excited by his astonishment at the wicked- <lb break="no"/>ness
          of the stranger, he thus answered <lb/>him: “Sir, your argument is altogether <lb/>a <seg

          pre- <lb break="no"/>sent possessors have improved it by their <lb/>labour, or by the
          purchase of labour, <lb/>and thence derive an absolute proper- <lb break="no"/>ty in the
          soil which they occupy. If <lb/>those who were born before us had the <lb/>choice of lands
          for settlements, we <lb/>have advantages which they could not <lb/>reap. The civilization
          of the human <pb/>
          <lb/>species has opened infinite avenues for <lb/>the attainment of riches; and the wants
          <lb/>of the community require the exercise <lb/>of trades and professions, which are so
          <lb/>many virtuous and lawful modes to <lb/>equalise property. The cultivator, the
          <lb/>merchant, the mechanic, the physician, <lb/>the lawyer, however poor at the com- <lb
            break="no"/>mencement of a career, may, by industry <lb/>and perseverance, acquire a
          full share of <lb/>wealth. If banks be the property of the <lb/>affluent, that affluence
          was honestly, or at <lb/>least legally acquired, and cannot be pur- <lb break="no"
          />loined, upon any pretext, without viola- <lb break="no"/>ting the laws which we are
          bound to sup- <lb break="no"/>port and not to infringe. And what se- <lb break="no"
          />curity should we have, according to your <lb/>maxims, for the enjoyment of our ill-
          <lb/>gotten wealth, admitting we could realize <lb/>it without detection? We should,
          agreea- <lb break="no"/>bly to your logic, be lawful prey for <lb/>every swindler who
          chose to make an at- <lb break="no"/>tempt upon us. From these considerations <pb/>
          <lb/>I must decline your proposal; and, Sir, <lb/>you must excuse me, if I also decline
          <lb/>your company.” </p>
        <p> “Young man,” replied the stranger, <lb/>“beware! you forget that you are in <lb/>my
          power. You owe me money, and <lb/>you cannot pay it.” </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Richard</persName> felt the melancholy truth of <lb/>this last remark; but, at
          all events, re- <lb break="no"/>solved to adhere to principles of recti- <lb break="no"
          />tude. The stranger said no more; but <lb/>rising from his seat, went down stairs. </p>
        <p> Our youthful adventurer sat for some <lb/>time, musing on the singular villany of
          <lb/>this man. He was now sensible of the <lb/>indiscretion of having accepted of his
          <lb/>money; and, for the first time in his <lb/>life, felt that to accept the favours of
          some <lb/>men is the greatest of calamities. Whilst <lb/>making reflections of this
          nature, he <lb/>arose and slowly descended the stair-case, <lb/>stepping leisurely to the
          door of the inn. <lb/>He stood there for some short time look- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ing around him, when a man, seemingly <lb/>in a hurry, stepped up to him,
          and asking <lb/>him if he had not come to that tavern <lb/>with another person,
          (describing <persName>Richard’s</persName>
          <lb/>companion,) informed him that he had a <lb/>little business with him, and that if he
          <lb/>would follow him to the office of a ma- <lb break="no"/>gistrate he would explain
          himself further. <lb/>The youth comprehended, at once, the <lb/>nature of the affair; and
          followed with- <lb break="no"/>out hesitation. When he arrived at the <lb/>magistrate’s
          office, <persName>Richard</persName> found his <lb/>late companion there, determined to
          pro- <lb break="no"/>secute his pecuniary claim to the utmost <lb/>extent of the law. The
          young man did not <lb/>pretend to deny the debt, but stated to <lb/>the justice the
          history of his whole ac- <lb break="no"/>quaintance with the stranger, concluding
          <lb/>with the proposition to circulate forged <lb/>bank notes, and observing that the pre-
            <lb break="no"/>sent action for the recovery of the money <lb/>lent was occasioned by
          his refusal to enter <lb/>into that <seg xml:id="a123" corresp="#n123"

              >Iniquitous</term>: wicked.</note> undertaking. </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> “Ah! the artful serpent!” exclaim- <lb break="no"/>ed the stranger, with profound
          gravity, <lb/>“Your honour may rely upon it that he <lb/>is one of the greatest rascals
          for his age <lb/>in the whole world. Last night I caught <lb/>him in the very act of
          picking my pock- <lb break="no"/>et; but I overlook that; and shall think <lb/>myself very
          happily rid of him if I can <lb/>only get my money from him that I lent <lb/>him. O boy!
          boy!” continued the man, <lb/>looking full in <persName>Richard’s</persName> face with
          great <lb/>seriousness, “What a viper you are. I <lb/>am astonished the earth does not
          open <lb/>and swallow you up! Ah! me.” And <lb/>he heaved a woful sigh. </p>
        <p> If <persName>Richard</persName> was surprised at the man’s <lb/>dishonesty before, he
          was now much <lb/>more astonished at his unblushing hypo- <lb break="no"/>crisy. As,
          however, he confessed the <lb/>debt, and was unable to pay it, he was <lb/>committed to
          gaol, whither the constable <lb/>conducted him. </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> Overwhelmed with this new misfor- <lb break="no"/>tune, <persName>Richard</persName>
          could not collect his scat- <lb break="no"/>tered thoughts until he reached the prison
          <lb/>door, when he called to mind his friend <lb/>the Quaker. Giving the address of the
          <lb/>latter to the constable, the youth desired <lb/>him to inform the Quaker that an
          unfor- <lb break="no"/>tunate young man wished to speak with <lb/>him at the debtor’s
          apartment; and the <lb/>constable, being a humane person, pro- <lb break="no"/>mised
          faithfully to perform the service. <lb/>The remainder of the day passed away,
          <lb/>however, and <persName>Richard’s</persName> expected friend <lb/>did not arrive. The
          youth became quite <lb/>despondent. He reproached himself for <lb/>having left
            <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> on the mere sug- <lb break="no"/>gestion of a few
          frivolous acquaintances, <lb/>and very justly attributed his recent dis- <lb break="no"
          />asters to that first false step. </p>
        <p> Among the individuals confined for <lb/>debt, was one who, the day previously <lb/>to
            <persName>Richard’s</persName> commitment, had cut his <lb/>throat in a fit of despair;
          but having been <pb/>
          <lb/>discovered before life was exhausted, the <lb/>wound was sewed up, and he was sup-
            <lb break="no"/>posed to be out of danger. The youth <lb/>visited him, but found him in
          such a <lb/>weak state that he could talk very little. <lb/><persName>Richard</persName>,
          nevertheless, questioned him as <lb/>to his motive for this attempt at suicide? <lb/>With
          much exertion the man made out <lb/>to tell him, that he had despaired of ever <lb/>being
          able to extricate himself from his <lb/>difficulties, and had finally determined to
          <lb/>destroy his life and free himself from the <lb/>world entirely. “And, surely,” said
          he, <lb/>“I had a right to do so, if I pleased.” </p>
        <p> “Would you think yourself justifia- <lb break="no"/>ble,” inquired
            <persName>Richard</persName>, “in destroying <lb/>the life of another person?” </p>
        <p> “Certainly not,” answered the man. </p>
        <p> “Neither have you,” said the youth, <lb/>“any right to curtail your own. Your
          <lb/>existence is the work of nature, in com- <lb break="no"/>mon with other beings of her

        <p> The physicians now entering, <persName>Richard</persName>
          <lb/>was compelled to retire, as the man’s <lb/>wound was irritated by his efforts to con-

        <p> The second day after the youth’s con- <lb break="no"/>finement, the Quaker unexpectedly
          called <lb/>at the prison. “Young man,” said he to <lb/><persName>Richard</persName>, “I
          learnt thy story yesterday <lb/>from the magistrate; and I am happy in <lb/>being able to
          inform thee that thy enemy <lb/>is taken, and will be punished, as a large <lb/>number of
          forged bank notes have been <lb/>found upon him. In attempting to pass <lb/>one he was
          detected, and was conveyed <lb/>before the same magistrate who commit- <lb break="no"/>ted
          thee. I have paid thy debt, and thou <lb/>art at liberty to leave the prison; but we
          <lb/>shall want thee as a witness to establish <lb/>the offender’s guilt; after which, I
          would <lb/>advise thee to betake thyself to a settled <lb/>mode of life, for in thy
          present wandering <lb/>condition thou wilt be continually liable <lb/>to misfortunes, and
          may, however vir- <lb break="no"/>tuous thou mayst be at present, eventually <lb/>be
          betrayed into vitious practices. And, <lb/>to convince thee that I am sincerely thy <pb/>
          <lb/>friend, I now offer to get thee a place in <lb/>the counting-house of a friend of
          mine.” <lb/><persName>Richard</persName> was struck with admiration at <lb/>the genuine
          and modest benevolence of <lb/>the Quaker, and returned him a thousand <lb/>thanks. He
          apologized for not accepting <lb/>his friendly offer, stating his intention of
          <lb/>proceeding to <placeName>Boston</placeName>, according to his <lb/>original design. </p>
        <p> “Then,” observed the Quaker, “I <lb/>will supply thee with money to bear thy
          <lb/>expenses; and thou canst pay me when <lb/>thou art able.” </p>
        <p> Matters being thus arranged, <persName>Richard</persName>
          <lb/>went into court on the day following, and <lb/>gave in evidence what he knew of the
          <lb/>counterfeiter, who was convicted, and <lb/>sentenced to hard labour for several
          <lb/>years. </p>
        <p> The Quaker gentleman took <persName>Richard</persName>
          <lb/>home from the court-house, and entertain- <lb break="no"/>ed him kindly until he was
          prepared to <lb/>depart for <placeName>Boston</placeName>; and, being furnished <pb/>
          <lb/>with a supply of money, he set off in the <lb/>stage-coach, well stored by his friend
          <lb/>with wholesome advice as well as money. <lb/><persName>Richard’s</persName> heart
          grew light as he roll- <lb break="no"/>ed gaily along towards
            <placeName>New-York</placeName>, and <lb/>he soon forgot all his preceding misad- <lb
            break="no"/>ventures for the contemplation of his <lb/>prospects of the future. When he
          en- <lb break="no"/>tered that city, he took his handkerchief <lb/>which embraced all his
          wardrobe, in his <lb/>hand, and sought for private lodgings, <lb/>determined to trust
          himself no longer at <lb/>taverns. One day’s sojournment at this <lb/>seat of taste and
          fashion, our traveller <choice><orig>concluede</orig><reg>con- <lb break="no"
              />cluded,</reg></choice> would not prove a violent breach <lb/>of his friend the

          />ty-four hours in viewing part of the <lb/>beauties of this rich and flourishing city.
          <lb/>Sauntering out in the morning, after ga- <lb break="no"/>zing about him for some
          time, he saw <lb/>a great crowd at a distance, towards which <lb/>he hastened, and as he
          drew near distinct- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ly heard the sound of a bell, and a voice <lb/>exclaiming, “This is the

            broken down into pro-French, anti-British Democratic-Republicans allied with

            anti-French Federalists concentrated in <placeName>New England</placeName>. From the
            14C, sturgeon were a “royal fish” in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, meaning all
            caught sturgeon were the property of the crown.</note> Here the bell-man rang a great
          <lb/>peal, which was repeated by a hundred <lb/>little bells, that chimed in harmony, and
          <lb/>sounded the praises of the immortal pa- <lb break="no"/>triot afar off. </p>
        <p> Leaving this congregation, <persName>Richard</persName> pro- <lb break="no"/>ceeded to
          another part of the city, where <lb/>he found another meeting, at which a mass <lb/>of
          people were listening to the loud ha- <lb break="no"/>rangue of a most voluble orator, who
          was <lb/>declaiming upon the subject of patriot- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ism. The youth reached the place just <lb/>as the speaker was concluding.
          “Let <lb/>us,” said the orator, “sacrifice all our <lb/>lives, men, women, and children,
          to save <lb/>the country. Let us all perish, so the <lb/>nation is saved. And the Lord
          give us <lb/>plenty, and drown all the English.” </p>
        <p> The youth now turned to go away, <lb/>when he saw, limping off, an old man <lb/>upon
          crutches. His face was furrowed <lb/>by cares, and his visage was sorrowful.
            <lb/><persName>Richard</persName> went up to him, and inquired into <lb/>the cause of
          his lameness. “Ah! young <lb/>man,” sighed he, “I was crippled at the <lb/><seg

            many soldiers sold these promissory notes to financial speculators for small percentages
            of their face value. The <persName>Washington</persName> administration, under the
            direction of <persName>Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton</persName>, controversially
            decided to honor these promissory notes at full value, creating great profits for the
            speculators.</note>
          <lb/>O! the blessed times of American spirit <lb/>are gone by. Wherever I go I hear
          <lb/>people talking about the French and the <lb/>English; but
            <placeName>America</placeName> is hardly ever <lb/>mentioned. Bad times, young man, bad <pb/>
          <lb/>times, indeed, when we lose sight of our- <lb break="no"/>selves to talk about other
          folks. But, <lb/>God bless you! young man; I must <lb/>limp home.” So saying he was making
          <lb/>off, when <persName>Richard</persName> slipped a dollar into <lb/>his pocket and
          walked from him rapidly <lb/>to avoid his remonstrances or his thanks. </p>
        <p> Young <persName><choice><orig>Orvain</orig><reg>Orvaine</reg></choice></persName> spent
          the greater part of <lb/>the day in surveying the city, and returned <lb/>from his
          afternoon walk a little before sun- <lb break="no"/>set. He found nobody at home but the
          <lb/>mistress of the house and the maid ser- <lb break="no"/>vant. The former was
          vehemently scold- <lb break="no"/>ing the latter for malconduct, and the <lb/>maid was as
          vehemently protesting her <lb/>innocence. This altercation was going <lb/>on in an inner
          apartment, and <persName>Richard’s</persName>
          <lb/>arrival was unknown to the lady and her <lb/>servant, or they, perhaps, would have
          been <lb/>more discreet in the utterance of their <lb/>criminations and apologies. The
          youth, <lb/>hearing the noise within, paused for some <lb/>time at the street door. “Upon
          my sal- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>vation, madam,” said the maid, “I have <lb/>not seen them.” “Wretch!”
          cried the <lb/>lady; “do you mock me? After caus- <lb break="no"/>ing me to lose one of
          the finest ideas that <lb/>ever occurred to mortal; nay, after break- <lb break="no"/>ing
          the chain of my ideas altogether, you <lb/>affect not to understand my meaning. <lb/>Quit
          my house this instant.” “O, <lb/>madam! madam!” exclaimed the terrified <lb/>maid,
          “indeed, indeed, I have not seen <lb/>your ideas: pardon, pardon, madam, I <lb/>will look
          for them; I’ll soon find them; <lb/>I know I shall.” “Will you get out!” <lb/>roared the
          mistress, excessively angry. <lb/><persName>Richard</persName>, who was afraid the storm
          would <lb/>expend its violence at the door at which <lb/>he stood, and not wishing to be
          an eye- <lb break="no"/>witness of a quarrel between two females, <lb/>hastened into the
          house, and got up stairs <lb/>unperceived. At first he could not clearly <lb/>comprehend
          the subject of this squabble; <lb/>but, on making some inquiries that even- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ing, in an indirect way, among the per- <lb break="no"/>manent lodgers, he
          understood that the <lb/>mistress of the house frequently indulged <lb/>in the composition
          of rhymes; from <lb/>which he concluded that the maid had in- <lb break="no"/>terrupted
          her in one of her musings, <lb/>which had broken in upon her reve- <lb break="no"/>rie,
          excited her anger, and impelled <lb/>her thus vociferously to rail at her ser- <lb
            break="no"/>vant. </p>
        <p> The youthful <persName><choice><orig>Orvain</orig><reg>Orvaine</reg></choice></persName>
          determined to <lb/>pursue his journey the ensuing day, and <lb/>prepared himself
          accordingly. Going <lb/>from his lodgings early in the morning <lb/>to secure himself a
          passage in one of the <lb/>packet-boats that ply through the sound, <lb/>he was stopped by
          a person in whose <lb/>countenance was depicted great despond- <lb break="no"/>ency, and
          who presented to <persName>Richard</persName> the <lb/><term style="font­-style: italic"
            >prospectus</term> of a new novel. The name <lb/>was to be “<bibl
            style="font­-style: italic">Views by Starlight</bibl>” and all <lb/>the thoughts and the
          style were to be ori- <lb break="no"/>ginal. “Pray,” said <persName>Richard</persName> to
          the man, <pb/>
          <lb/>are you the author of this proposed <lb/>work?” “Yes, Sir.” “Did you ever <lb/>print
          a work of the kind heretofore.” <lb/>“O Yes! Sir; but nobody would buy <lb/>it.” “Well,”
          replied <persName>Richard</persName>, “I will <lb/>tell you the reason of it, and give you
          <lb/>some advice on the subject. In the first <lb/>place you are wrong to announce, as you
          <lb/>have done in this <term style="font­-style: italic">prospectus</term>, that the
          <lb/>work was written by an American, or <lb/>even that it was composed in
            <placeName>America</placeName>. <lb/>That, I dare say, is what ruined the sale <lb/>of
          your former novel. Your title, too, is <lb/>much too plain. If you would call it
            <lb/>“<bibl style="font­-style: italic">The Jug with Forty Handles</bibl>” or some- <lb
            break="no"/>thing of that sort, and insert in the title <lb/>page, that it is from the
          pen of a cele- <lb break="no"/>brated English or French writer, and that <lb/>it is
          reprinted from the one hundred and <lb/>forty-ninth European edition, you will in- <lb
            break="no"/>fallibly succeed.” The man was struck <lb/>with the whimsicality of this
          advice, and <lb/>promised to follow it. <persName>Richard</persName> remarked <pb/>
          <lb/>that as he was a stranger, about to leave <lb/>the city, and probably should never
          see <lb/>the author again, he must decline sub- <lb break="no"/>scribing for the work. He
          heard after- <Lb break="no"/>wards, however, that the man had pursu- <lb break="no"/>ed
          the plan he had recommended, that the <lb/>people had purchased up his books as fast
          <lb/>as he could have them printed, and that <lb/>the author by this means got exceedingly
          <lb/>rich. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Richard</persName> proceeded to the packet-boat, <lb/>paid for a <seg

          />fore he presented himself before the friend <lb/>of his father.
            <persName>Richard</persName> had much know- <lb break="no"/>ledge of the human heart. He
          had no <lb/>reason to doubt being favourably re- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>ceived by a man upon whom his parent <lb/>had heaped innumerable bounties;
          but <lb/>he knew that prosperity is apt to corrupt <lb/>the purest of hearts, and to bias
          the best <lb/>of intentions. He resolved to inquire <lb/>into the prevailing character of
          the ancient <lb/>inmate of his father’s house, and to glean <lb/>from the general report
          the complexion <lb/>of his reputation, before he disclosed to <lb/>him the purpose of his
          visit to <placeName>Boston</placeName>. <lb/>In the interval, he amused himself with
          <lb/>visiting every thing that was remarkable <lb/>and to which he could get access in the
          <lb/>place. On some occasions he diverted <lb/>the tediousness of his hours by writing
          <lb/>brief essays upon popular topics, some <lb/>of which he sent to the press, and was
          <lb/>pleased to see that they were generally <lb/>published. Among other productions of
          <lb/>his fancy, the following trifle was sent for <lb/>insertion to one of the leading

        <p> Another singular character who boarded <lb/>in company with

          him great credit <lb/>with politicians expectant; insomuch, <lb/>that he actually lived
          upon the pre- <lb break="no"/>sents he received from numbers of per- <lb break="no"/>sons
          who were under the impression that <lb/>he had great weight with the constituted
          <lb/>authorities. </p>
        <p> Whilst <persName>Richard</persName> lodged in the same <lb/>house with him, he took
          great delight in <lb/>tracing the peculiarities of these two per- <lb break="no"/>sons.
          But the youth did not remain <lb/>long in his present situation. The ser- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>vant who had conveyed his rhymes to <lb/>the press, had informed the
          printer <lb/>where the writer of them resided; and <lb/>the printer, showing the
          production, be- <lb break="no"/>fore it made its appearance, to some of <lb/>his
          acquaintances, they all became anx- <lb break="no"/>ious to see our youth, who was accord-
            <lb break="no"/>ingly sent for.
              <persName><choice><orig>Orvain</orig><reg>Orvaine</reg></choice></persName> attended
          immed- <lb break="no"/>iately, and met with a very agreeable <lb/>circle of gentlemen, by
          one of whom he <lb/>was informed that there was a new pe- <lb break="no"/>riodical
          publication about to be com- <lb break="no"/>menced, and that if he had no objection,
          <lb/>they would preserve his rhymes for the <lb/>first number; to which he assented.
          <lb/>The company then gradually proceeded <lb/>to inquire into his history, which
            <persName>Ri- <lb break="no"/>chard</persName> without hesitation truly narrated;
          <lb/>concluding by saying he hoped to find <lb/>his father’s friend propitious to his de-
            <lb break="no"/>sires. “And you shall not be disap- <lb break="no"/>pointed,” said an
          elderly gentleman, <lb/>rising up and taking him by the hand. <lb/>I am that friend; and
          in my house you <lb/>will find a welcome home. <persName>Richard</persName>
          <lb/>was much pleased at this fortunate intro- <lb break="no"/>duction, and made very
          proper acknow- <lb break="no"/>ledgments to the gentleman, who took <lb/>him to his
          counting-house; and on the <lb/>following day a plan was arranged where- <lb break="no"
          />by young <persName><choice><orig>Orvain</orig><reg>Orvaine</reg></choice></persName> was
          to remain with <lb/>his father’s friend until he was of lawful <lb/>age, when he was to be
          established in <lb/>business for himself. The history of <lb/>an apprenticeship in a
          merchant’s service, <lb/>affords few remarkable incidents. <persName>Ri- <lb break="no"
            />chard</persName> was faithful to his engagement, as <lb/>was <persName>Mr.
            Fairlong</persName> to his. He comple- <lb break="no"/>ted the education of the youth;
          treated <lb/>him with gentleness and affection; and, <lb/>in the last year of his term,
          fully con- <lb break="no"/>fiding in his probity, sent him to <placeName>En- <lb
              break="no"/>gland</placeName> to transact some confidential busi- <lb break="no"

        <p> Whilst <persName>Richard</persName> resided with <persName>Mr. <lb/>Fairlong</persName>,
          that gentleman made him sun- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>dry presents, which the young man care- <lb break="no"/>fully preserved
          and occasionally sent to <lb/>his mother. In the course of his ap- <lb break="no"
          />prenticeship, the liberality of <persName>Mr. Fair- <lb break="no"/>long</persName>
          enabled him also to repay the loan <lb/>of his Quaker friend, to whom he trans- <lb

            <persName>Richard</persName> informed him how sen- <lb break="no"/>sible he was of his

          <lb/>was indebted for the money he had lost <lb/>with his young associates at cards, he
          re- <lb break="no"/>mitted the amount that he owed, together <lb/>with interest thereon. </p>

        <p> In the mean while, <persName>Rosa</persName> grew in stature, <lb/>in beauty, and
          improved in mental ac- <lb break="no"/>complishments. <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>
          spared <lb/>no pains nor expense in her education; <lb/>and her pride being repressed by
          the <lb/>recollection of her former humble con- <lb break="no"/>dition, her temper was
          easily modulated <lb/>to the sweetest equability. In this parti- <lb break="no"/>cular
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> had herself suffered <lb/>so much, that she guarded,
          with sedulous <lb/>attention, against the formation of an <lb/>irritable or peevish
          disposition in <persName>Rosa</persName>. <lb/>The usefulness of the needle; the inge- <lb
            break="no"/>nious contrivances of fancy; to read with <lb/>understanding, and to write
          with needful <lb/>cleverness were all familiar to the orphan <lb/>maid. Nor was she
          deficient in the <lb/>knowledge of domestic economy, which <pb/>
          <lb/>is so necessary to the rich, and which is <lb/>indispensable to the poor. In truth,
          four <lb/>years of tuition, under the auspices of her <lb/>protectress, made
            <persName>Rosa</persName> the delight of <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, the
          admiration of her <lb/>friends, and the attractive point of the so- <lb break="no"/>cial
          circle of her youthful acquaintances. <lb/>She danced, she sung, she played on
          <lb/>several instruments of music; and she <lb/>was at once the life of the ball-room, the
          <lb/>enchantress of private parties, and the <lb/>most captivating of companions. Her
          <lb/>reverence and attention to the admonitions <lb/>of the old, her modest diffidence in
          the <lb/>presence of persons of middle age, and <lb/>her innocent and decorous
          sprightliness <lb/>when with the juvenile and the gay, won <lb/>hearts without number, and
          every where <lb/>conciliated esteem. </p>
        <p> On first introducing <persName>Rosa</persName> into com- <lb break="no"/>pany,
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> was always her con- <lb break="no"/>stant attendant.
          And when they had re- <lb break="no"/>turned home, she would scrutinize to her <pb/>
          <lb/>in private, the various characters of the <lb/>persons with whom they had spent the
          <lb/>day or the evening. She would make <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName> remark the
          different qualities which <lb/>made up the minds of her acquaintances, <lb/>so that she
          might be enabled to appre- <lb break="no"/>ciate their characters more justly. “In

          my <lb/>dear girl, (said she,) all the vivacity of a <lb/>French woman without her
          frivolity, a <lb/>spice of envy, an unpleasant spirit of du- <lb break="no"/>plicity, and
          a continual exertion to im- <lb break="no"/>press you with the opinion that she is a
          <lb/>woman of masculine sense. She does <lb/>not perceive that if she could fairly esta-
            <lb break="no"/>blish such a character, she would lose <lb/>that more amiable one of our
          sex, which <lb/>is infinitely more influential in society. <lb/>There is <persName>Mrs.
            Parterre</persName>, who is as gaudy <lb/>as a butterfly, and although she has been
          <lb/>married for ten years, is as simpering as <lb/>a young lady of fifteen. Such
          incongrui- <lb break="no"/>ty of dress and character tend to make <pb/>
          <lb/>her ridiculous. In <persName>Mrs. Mordaunt</persName> the <lb/>imagination is for
          ever at war with the <lb/>judgment; and in the next moment her <lb/>understanding condemns
          what her fancy <lb/>had impelled her to utter the moment <lb/>before. By this means she
          has rendered <lb/>herself capricious and inconsistent in be- <lb break="no"/>haviour.
            <persName>Miss Seemly</persName> is always declaring <lb/>how much she detests the
          odious men; <lb/>yet her manner of saying so only proves <lb/>that nothing is more
          desirable to her than <lb/>their attentions. <persName>Miss Flirt</persName> plays the co-
            <lb break="no"/>quette, because she has mistaken the ver- <lb break="no"/>satility of
          that character for the vivacious- <lb break="no"/>ness of natural gaiety. She, therefore,
          <lb/>has no dignity in her character, and of <lb/>course
              <choice><sic>litttle</sic><corr>little</corr></choice> respect is paid to her by
          <lb/>any body. In short, my good <persName>Rosa</persName>, our <lb/>sex renders itself
          frequently unhappy by <lb/>the false application of female power. <lb/>It is only to place
          ourselves in the pro- <lb break="no"/>per light, and we cannot fail to be esti- <lb
            break="no"/>mated by men of sense at our true value. <pb/>
          <lb/>More than that we ought not require: <lb/>if we do, we are impostors.” </p>

          <lb/>to all her views of life, previously to cer- <lb break="no"/>tain fruition, to make
          her own bosom the <lb/>sole depository of them. <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>

          young men <pb/>
          <lb/>derived from girls in their teens, who, in <lb/>addition to their being very
          incompetent <lb/>judges, are generally influenced by envy, <lb/>by disappointment, or by
          revenge; and <lb/>who are commonly instigated more by the <lb/>colour and vehemence of
          their own pas- <lb break="no"/>sions, than by the truth: but in all cases <lb/>to decide
          upon the qualities of men from <lb/>personal observation of their manners, of <lb/>their
          avowed ideas, and of their noto- <lb break="no"/>rious actions. Uniformly fortified in
          this <lb/>way by <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, <persName>Rosa</persName> became
          <lb/>circumspect without prudery or affecta- <lb break="no"/>tion, and agreeable without
          tattling. Of <lb/>those whom she esteemed, she invaria- <lb break="no"/>bly spoke well: of
          those whom she dis- <lb break="no"/>liked, she said nothing. </p>
        <p> With her charms, her acquirements, <lb/>and perfections, <persName>Rosa</persName>
          attracted a crowd <lb/>of suitors at the age of sixteen; suitors <lb/>who were such in
          fact, and not pretenders, <lb/>who idly professed their attachment, and <lb/>danced in
          attendance upon her, for the <pb/>
          <lb/>purpose of boasting of their prowess over <lb/>her heart, or of being admitted to her
          fa- <lb break="no"/>miliar conversation. But the lessons of <lb/><persName>Mrs.

          />sed on by her demeanour towards them, <lb/>it was attributable to their own vanity,
          <lb/>to self-delusion, and not to the language <lb/>or behaviour of
            <persName>Rosa</persName>. She never, for a <lb/>single instant, suffered her sentiment
          or <lb/>her passion to be misunderstood: her in- <lb break="no"/>dications of esteem were
          always so re- <lb break="no"/>spectful and polite; her dislike of arro- <lb break="no"
          />gant presumption was manifested with so <lb/>much delicate reserve; and the character
          <lb/>of her conduct was so distinctly marked <lb/>in every instance, that no one could
          mis- <lb break="no"/>take the sensation of her heart, or the <lb/>thought of her head. </p>
        <p> Among the fluttering fops and busy <lb/>beaux who pranced in the circle of her
          <lb/>admirers, was <persName>Mr. George Belmain</persName>, a <pb/>
          <lb/>young man who had just arrived at the <lb/>age of twenty-one, and at the full enjoy-
            <lb break="no"/>ment of an independent fortune. He <lb/>was rather handsome than
          otherwise; <lb/>and his brain was completely overrun <lb/>with notions of his own
          importance, con- <lb break="no"/>ceiving himself to be superior among the <lb/>men, and
          irresistible with the women. <lb/>Light and airy in his disposition, his ac- <lb
            break="no"/>complishments were altogether superfi- <lb break="no"/>cial. At a ball he
          was agile; in a supper- <lb/>room officious; in private parties <seg xml:id="a138"

          acceptable to <persName>Rosa</persName>: indeed the <lb/>only doubt on his part was,
          whether he <lb/>would descend to woo her. His own <lb/>consent, he conceived, was all that
          was <lb/>necessary to ensure his marriage with <lb/>any lady with whom he could possibly
          <lb/>meet. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Belmain’s</persName> ignorant assurance was sin- <lb break="no"/>gularly
          contrasted by the sighing adora- <lb break="no"/>tions of <persName>Mr, Philip
            Peerwell</persName>. This young <lb/>man was tolerably well educated, of small
          <lb/>fortune, and had a constitution of great <lb/>excitability. He was desperately in

          <lb/>trusted in the power of sympathy: he <pb/>
          <lb/>thought that if the human heart was ever <lb/>melted with pity or with love, it would
          <lb/>be softened in his individual case. Such <lb/>mountains of wo; such continual anxie-
            <lb break="no"/>ty of feeling; such timorous bashfulness, <lb/>deserved, in his
          estimation, a noble re- <lb break="no"/>turn from a susceptible female heart. A

          anonymous, did he indite and <lb/>transmit to her by various conveyances. <lb/>His
          hand-writing he did not disguise, and <lb/>he trusted by that she would recognise <lb/>the
          person of her adorer. He had invoked <lb/>the whole heathen mythology to inspire <lb/>him
          on these occasions; the four winds <lb/>of Heaven were held in perpetual requi- <lb
            break="no"/>sition to waft his sighs to the enchanting <lb/>fair: and he finally began
          to look for- <lb break="no"/>ward to the period when he conceived <lb/>she must inevitably
          declare herself in his <lb/>favour, and like the balmy fragrance of <lb/>an Arabian gale,
          gently refresh his be- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>wildered senses, by breathing in his ear <lb/>the vows of everlasting
          affection. </p>
        <p> It was whilst these two admirers of <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName>, so different in
          their characters, <lb/>were pursuing their object in their several <lb/>modes, that
            <persName>Richard</persName> returned from <placeName>En- <lb break="no"
            />gland</placeName>, after having successfully negotiated <lb/>the business of his
          voyage, much to the <lb/>satisfaction of his patrons in <placeName>Boston</placeName>.
          <lb/>The period was now arrived when they <lb/>determined to establish him in business,
          <lb/>being sufficiently well assured of his <lb/>steadiness and industry. Previously to
          <lb/>his entrance upon the avocations of a <lb/>merchant, however, he concluded to visit
            <lb/><placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, to have an interview with his <lb/>family, and
          enjoy the satisfaction of meet- <lb break="no"/>ing his old acquaintances under the ex-
            <lb break="no"/>isting prosperous aspect of his fortune. <lb/>Intimating his desire to
          his friends in <lb/><placeName>Boston</placeName>, he accordingly departed for the
          <lb/>southward, and, reaching the residence <lb/>of his mother and his sisters and
          brothers, <pb/>
          <lb/>he was received into the bosom of his <lb/>family, with congratulations and emotions
          <lb/>of the most endearing affection. No one <lb/>knew the true value of time better than
            <lb/><persName>Richard Orvaine</persName>. He settled upon his <lb/>mother and the
          family a yearly stipend, <lb/>which he engaged to remit them quar- <lb break="no"/>terly;
          and, having made this arrange- <lb break="no"/>ment, the only thing that detained him
          <lb/>in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, was the desire of spending <lb/>a day with
            <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, who had been <lb/>so partial to him when a boy. </p>
        <p> Having equipped himself in a hand- <lb break="no"/>some dress, one morning after
          breakfast <lb/>he waited upon his old acquaintance, <lb/>who at first did not recollect
          his features; <lb/>but young <persName>Orvaine</persName> soon made himself <lb/>known,
          and the disclosure of his person <lb/>was followed by <persName>Mr. Derwent’s</persName>
          insisting <lb/>on being told the incidents of his life, <lb/>from the period of his so
          precipitately <lb/>leaving <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>. <persName>Richard</persName>
          very candidly <lb/>related every circumstance as it had really <pb/>
          <lb/>occurred, and their interview was drawn <lb/>to a close by <persName>Mr.
            Derwent’s</persName> hearty ex- <lb break="no"/>pressions of joy at his prosperous
          condi- <lb break="no"/>tion and his brilliant prospects. “But, <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Orvaine</persName>,” said the old gentleman, “you <lb/>must accompany me this
          evening to a <lb/>party, where, if you are no gambler, you <lb/>will be exceedingly
          amused; and to-mor- <lb break="no"/>row, my friend, I must insist upon intro- <lb
            break="no"/>ducing you to a lady with whom I am <lb/>sure you will be very much
          pleased.” <lb/><persName>Orvaine</persName> promised to comply with his re- <lb break="no"
          />quest; and spent the time between morn- <lb break="no"/>ing and evening, in visiting the
          resident <lb/>merchants of the place, in soliciting their <lb/>countenance in trade, and
          in endeavouring <lb/>to institute a correspondence which should <lb/>be mutually
          beneficial. To this object <lb/>he had previously paid some attention, <lb/>and he had the
          satisfaction, before his de- <lb break="no"/>parture from
          <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, of being enabled <lb/>to carry with him the good wishes
          of a <lb/>number of shopkeepers, and to have ef- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>fected with some of them, favourable and <lb/>positive engagements. </p>
        <p> On the approach of evening, <persName>Mr. Or- <lb break="no"/>vaine</persName> repaired
          to <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, whom <lb/>he found in readiness to proceed to the
          <lb/>house of—whom do you think, reader? <lb/>Of beau <persName>Botherum</persName>! who a
          thousand <lb/>times in vain had solicited the honour of <lb/><persName>Mr.
            Derwent’s</persName> company at one of his <lb/>numerous card parties; and this very
          <lb/>day had teased him until he had pro- <lb break="no"/>mised to try to make it
          convenient to <lb/>visit him in the evening. But that con- <lb break="no"/>venience had
          certainly never happened, <lb/>had not <persName>Orvaine</persName> opportunely arrived;
          <lb/>and to him, <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> knew, the scene <lb/>to be exhibited at
          beau <persName>Botherum’s</persName>, <lb/>would be highly diverting. Towards <lb/>the
          beau’s, therefore, they bent their <lb/>course; and entering a room, already <lb/>lighted
          up, they beheld the card tables <lb/>set forth, and certain males and females
          <lb/>adventuring at <seg xml:id="a144" corresp="#n144"><term style="font-style: italic"

          <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> was <pb/>

          Young <persName>Orvaine</persName>, on being <lb/>introduced, attracted attention for a
          mo- <lb break="no"/>ment; one old belle glanced an eye at <lb/>him through her spectacles;
          a newly <lb/>married lady knit her brows, and looked <lb/>at him with a frown as she led
          out the <lb/>ace of clubs: but the passion for gam- <lb break="no"/>ing, quickly absorbed
          every other con- <lb break="no"/>sideration. <persName>Orvaine</persName> soon perceived
          that <lb/>he was not invited to a party of the gra- <lb break="no"/>ces: A wasting
          consumption betrayed <lb/>itself upon the pallid cheeks of several of <lb/>the female
          players; the faces of others <lb/>were bloated and <seg xml:id="a146" corresp="#n146"

              >Blowzy</term>: red and coarse-complexioned.</note> both being <lb/>the effects of an
          irregular life. Whilst <lb/><persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> and his young companion
          <lb/>were sitting quietly looking on, a message <lb/>came to one of the women that her
          <lb/>child had been taken sick; a faint spark <lb/>of maternal affection, made her pause
          <lb/>for a moment; but, eyeing the amount of <pb/>
          <lb/>the loo on the table, she very coolly told <lb/>the messenger to send for a doctor.
          To <lb/>another, information was brought that <lb/>her husband had returned from a distant
          <lb/>place (after an absence of a month) very <lb/>much fatigued and in bad health. “Ah!”
          <lb/>said she, “he is always complaining: <lb/>pray what’s <seg xml:id="a147"

          midnight.” To a third, <lb/>intelligence was communicated that her <lb/>mother had been
          seized with a fainting <lb/>fit. “I have long expected the old wo- <lb break="no"/>man to
          be taken off suddenly,” was her <lb/>observation, concluding with “Major, <lb/>play to the
          deuce.” </p>
        <p> Company of this description might <lb/>amuse for a moment, but could not long
          <lb/>entertain minds like those of <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>
          <lb/>and <persName>Richard Orvaine</persName>. They soon be- <lb break="no"/>came
          disgusted, and pitied the infatua- <lb break="no"/>tion which thus tended to corrupt the
          <lb/>heart and vitiate the manners of the fair <lb/>sex. The two visitors were determined <pb/>
          <lb/>to depart as soon as possible, and this <lb/>determination was strengthened by the
          <lb/>occurrence of an unpleasant altercation <lb/>which arose between the card-players.
          <lb/>It seems that among his other guests, <lb/>beau <persName>Botherum</persName> had
          invited a young gen- <lb break="no"/>tleman from the country, who was reputed <lb/>to be
          wealthy, but was somewhat inex- <lb break="no"/>perienced. This young man thought he
          <lb/>was cheated, but waited until he should <lb/>have palpable evidence of the fact,
          before <lb/>he openly accused the party cheating. <lb/>At last he detected <persName>Mrs.
            Arabella Fugi- <lb break="no"/>tive</persName> in the unlady-like act of playing the
          <lb/>queen of hearts twice in the same hand, <lb/>and he cried out, “Double dealing, by
          <lb/>jingo!” <persName>Major Opossum</persName>, who was a <lb/><seg xml:id="a148"

          flourishing his fist, swore, <lb/>with a prodigious thump upon the table, <lb/>that nobody
          should accuse <persName>Mrs. Arabella <lb/>Fugitive</persName> of foul play with impunity,
          <lb/>whilst his name was <persName>Major Opossum</persName>. <pb/>
          <lb/>The country gentleman was startled, <lb/>and not being sufficiently acquainted with
          the <lb/>Major’s real character, began to apologize. <lb/><persName>Opossum</persName>
          extended the hand of forgive- <lb break="no"/>ness, and the female players, smiling with
          <lb/>singular condescension, all was restored <lb/>to harmony, <persName>Mrs.
            Fugitive</persName> herself re- <lb break="no"/>marking, that every person was liable to
          <lb/>be mistaken. </p>
        <p> From this scene, now become so odi- <lb break="no"/>ous, <persName>Mr.
            Derwent</persName> and <persName>Orvaine</persName>, after <lb/>sipping a cup of tea,
          retired; beau <lb/><persName>Botherum</persName> protesting, as they left the <lb/>house,
          that he should be eternally obliged <lb/>to them for the favour; and, in fact, on
          <lb/>this occasion he spoke with great sincerity, <lb/>for his residence had become so
          notorious <lb/>as a rendezvous for gamblers and fashion- <lb break="no"/>able <seg

          men as <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> to visit him, <pb/>
          <lb/>as by that means he would support the <lb/>credit of his house. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Mr. Orvaine</persName> parted from <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>
          <lb/>for the evening, but was under a promise <lb/>to return to him in the morning, to pay
          a <lb/>visit to that particular lady, of whom he <lb/>had previously spoken to
            <persName>Orvaine</persName>. <persName>Ri- <lb break="no"/>chard</persName> diverted
          his mother and sisters and <lb/>brothers with the recital of the incidents <lb/>of the
          card party at beau <persName>Botherum’s</persName>; <lb/>and very emphatically remarked in
          the <lb/>sequel, that <emph style="font­-style: italic">a woman who is devoted to <lb/>the
            gaming table, cannot be a dutiful <lb/>daughter, an affectionate wife, a tender
            <lb/>mother, nor a good domestic economist.</emph>
        </p>
        <p> In the morning <persName>Orvaine</persName> waited upon <lb/>his friend <persName>Mr.
            Derwent</persName>, and they pro- <lb break="no"/>ceeded together in his carriage to
            <persName>Mrs. <lb/>Charmion’s</persName>. It was now that our youth <lb/>for the first
          time beheld the blooming <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName>, rich in every charm and adorned
          by <lb/>all the graces. <persName>Mr. Orvaine</persName> had been <lb/>hitherto so much
          employed in business, <pb/>
          <lb/>that he had not paid great attention to the <lb/>ladies; but he was perfectly easy in
          his <lb/>manners, polite in his address, and very <lb/>agreeable in conversation. He was
          tall <lb/>and handsome: a manly countenance, a <lb/>fine forehead, and a quick but modest
          <lb/>eye, rendered him still more pleasing. <lb/>But what made him most captivating, was
          <lb/>a reflecting, intelligent mind, a ready and <lb/>lively wit, a just notion of men and
          <lb/>things, and a decorum and dignity of <lb/>behaviour, which made him on all occa- <lb
            break="no"/>sions respectable and respected. </p>
        <p> The heart of <persName>Rosa</persName> was susceptible; <lb/>and the appearance and
          intellectual quali- <lb break="no"/>ties of <persName>Richard Orvaine</persName> were
          calculated <lb/>to attract her attention. The youth him- <lb break="no"/>self found that
          he was affected with sen- <lb break="no"/>sations that were altogether new to him. <lb/>He
          had entered the door of <persName>Mrs. Charmi- <lb break="no"/>on</persName> with the idea
          of departing for <placeName>Boston</placeName>
          <lb/>on the morrow, but for once in his life he <lb/>found a determination deliberately
          formed <lb/>shaken by a trivial intervening incident. <pb/>
          <lb/>On his way to the city from <persName>Mrs. Charmi- <lb break="no"/>on’s</persName>
          villa, he remarked to <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>
          <lb/>that he thought he should tarry in <placeName>Balti- <lb break="no"/>more</placeName>
          a few days longer. <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>
          <lb/>perceived, although <persName>Orvaine</persName> did not con- <lb break="no"/>fess,
          the motive; and as he could see no <lb/>natural or moral impropriety in the object <lb/>of
          his delay, he did not discourage him. <lb/><persName>Richard</persName> mentioned his
          visit of the day to <lb/>his mother, who assured him that <persName>Rosa</persName>
          <lb/>was the admiration of every body that <lb/>knew her; that she was a young lady of
          <lb/>a most excellent heart, of the sweetest <lb/>temper, and of the most finished accom-
            <lb break="no"/>plishments. These commendations in- <lb break="no"/>flamed the
          imagination of <persName>Orvaine</persName> very <lb/>highly; and he soon betrayed every
          <lb/>symptom of love. He did not fail to re- <lb break="no"/>new his visits to the villa,
          and was equally <lb/>successful in winning the esteem of <persName>Mrs.
            <lb/>Charmion</persName> and in improving the good <lb/>will of
            <persName>Rosa</persName>. The latter found herself <lb/>more interested in his
          conversation at <pb/>
          <lb/>every repeated visit; and it was obvious <lb/>to every body at last that the flame of
          <lb/>gentle but strong affection was mutual <lb/>between them. How sudden are the
          <lb/>revolutions of the heart! A week before, <lb/>and <persName>Rosa</persName> and
            <persName>Orvaine</persName> were unknown to <lb/>each other. Eight days had elapsed,
          and <lb/>the fate of each had become reciprocally <lb/>and inexpressibly dear and
          precious! <lb/>On the eve of his departure, <persName>Orvaine</persName>, <lb/>through his
          friend <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, made <lb/>proposals of marriage between
            <persName>Rosa</persName> and <lb/>himself, to <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>. The
          nego- <lb break="no"/>tiation was speedily terminated. <persName>Mrs.
            <lb/>Charmion</persName> had no reluctance to yield her <lb/>assent, for she saw there
          existed mutual <lb/>regard and esteem; nor did the shortness <lb/>of their acquaintance
          oppose any obstacle <lb/>to the projected union; but it was indis- <lb break="no"
          />pensable, she said, that <persName>Mr. Orvaine</persName> should <lb/>procure
          testimonials of his character and <lb/>standing in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, before
          she could de- <lb break="no"/>liver <persName>Rosa</persName> into his protecting care.
          The <pb/>
          <lb/>young man at once produced letters from <lb/>the first merchants in
            <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, who <lb/>spoke of him in terms of the greatest
          con- <lb break="no"/>fidence and respect. These letters were <lb/>deposited in the hands
          of <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, <lb/>who, on inquiring among the commercial <lb/>men
          of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, ascertained that the <lb/>writers of them were
          persons of the strict- <lb break="no"/>est probity, and worthy of full credit for
          <lb/>whatever they asserted. <persName>Orvaine</persName> pro- <lb break="no"/>mised
          likewise to procure the assent of <lb/>his friends in <placeName>Boston</placeName> to the
          union; and <lb/>having made all necessary arrangements, <lb/>and the day of their marriage
          being de- <lb break="no"/>signated, he set out for <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>,
          <lb/>promising to write to the young lady <lb/>frequently, under cover to <persName>Mrs.
            Char- <lb break="no"/>mion</persName>. </p>
        <p> The rumour of the intended nuptials <lb/>soon spread abroad, and roused the angry
          <lb/>pride of <persName>Belmain</persName>; exciting despair at the <lb/>same time in the
          heart of <persName>Peerwell</persName>. The <lb/>former did not so much care for the loss <pb/>
          <lb/>of <persName>Rosa</persName>, (with whom he was nevertheless <lb/>enraptured,) as he
          was mortified that <persName>Or- <lb break="no"/>vaine</persName>, a mere adventurer! as
          he called <lb/>him, should carry off the prize without <lb/>asking his permission.
            <persName>Peerwell</persName> indited <lb/>a desperate epistle to the lady, reproach-
            <lb break="no"/>ing her with cruelty, and threatening <lb/>vengeance upon
            <persName>Orvaine</persName>. <persName>Rosa</persName> was <lb/>considerably alarmed at
          this intimation, <lb/>really fearing that <persName>Peerwell</persName>, in a fit of in-
            <lb break="no"/>sanity, might do an injury to her lover. <lb/>But, on communicating her
          apprehensions <lb/>to <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, she dispelled her fears <lb/>by
          saying that his passion would soon <lb/>evaporate, and he would become more <lb/>rational. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Belmain</persName> had a wicked heart; but he <lb/>was the vilest of cowards. He
          had al- <lb break="no"/>ways treated <persName>Peerwell</persName> with the utmost
          <lb/>contempt; but now, hearing of his <lb/>howlings and lamentations at the pros- <lb
            break="no"/>pect of <persName>Rosa’s</persName> marriage, he resolved to <lb/>make use
          of him as a tool to wreak his <pb/>
          <lb/>hate upon <persName>Orvaine</persName>, and consequently to <lb/>afflict the
          sensibility of the young lady. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Belmain</persName> inflamed the anger of <persName>Peerwell</persName>
          <lb/>by persuading him that he had been <lb/>duped; and consulting together, they
          <lb/>formed a plan to maltreat <persName>Orvaine</persName> on his <lb/>return to
            <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>. The latter, on his <lb/>arrival at
            <placeName>Boston</placeName>, communicated his ma- <lb break="no"/>trimonial intentions
          to his friends, who <lb/>applauded his resolution, conceiving the <lb/>marriage state to
          be most conducive to <lb/>steadiness and application to business. <lb/>He now commenced
          his operations in the <lb/>mercantile line, and fitted up a dwelling- <lb/>house for the
          reception and accommoda- <lb break="no"/>tion of his intended bride; in the mean
          <lb/>time, <persName>Rosa</persName> was not forgotten. He wrote <lb/>to her often, and
          transmitted to her, <lb/><seg xml:id="a150" corresp="#n150">coastwise,</seg><note

        <p> Having procured a person to superin- <lb break="no"/>tend his affairs in
            <placeName>Boston</placeName> during his tem- <lb break="no"/>porary absence, and
          likewise prevailed on <pb/>
          <lb/>his father’s friend and his own protector, <lb/>to accompany him to
            <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, <persName>Orvaine</persName>
          <lb/>departed southwardly, to fulfil his nuptial <lb/>engagement. On his arrival, joy was
          <kb/>the prevailing emotion. <persName>Orvaine’s</persName> mother <lb/>was gratified to
          see <persName>Mr. Fairlong</persName>, and <lb/>returned him a thousand thanks for his
          <lb/>friendly protection and encouragement <lb/>of her son. The meeting between
            <persName>Rosa</persName>
          <lb/>and <persName>Orvaine</persName> may be depicted by the <lb/>modest glances of the
          living eye, and the <lb/>reddening blushes of the bloomy cheek; <lb/>but cannot be
          described by the pen nor <lb/>by the pencil with accuracy. <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Fairlong</persName> and <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> were much <lb/>pleased
          with each other; and the select <lb/>circle of acquaintances in which the youth- <lb
            break="no"/>ful pair visited and were entertained, vied <lb/>in the elegance and
          sentimental complex- <lb break="no"/>ion which, on this occasion, they gave to <lb/>their
          parties. </p>
        <p> One evening about dusk, as <persName>Rosa</persName>, in <LB/>company with
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> and some <pb/>
          <lb/>other ladies, was returning to the villa <lb/>from paying a visit, and
            <persName>Orvaine</persName> was <lb/>riding in attendance at some distance be- <lb
            break="no"/>hind the carriage, he perceived a man <lb/>muffled up, with something
          extended in <lb/>his hand like a bludgeon. All at once, <lb/>as
            <persName>Orvaine</persName> came opposite to it, an explo- <lb break="no"/>sion of
          gunpowder took place, and the <lb/>man appeared to fall down, whilst another <lb/>person
          who stood at some distance, and <lb/>who was not at first perceived, ran off <lb/>with
          great speed. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Orvaine</persName> (whose horse was a little start- <lb break="no"/>led)
          dismounted, and went up to the fallen <lb/>man, who groaned as if he was much in- <lb
            break="no"/>jured. At first our young merchant <lb/>imagined the person had shot
          himself; <lb/>but in this he was soon undeceived; for <lb/>the prostrate creature, looking
          in <persName>Orvaine’s</persName>
          <lb/>face, begged for mercy. “Indeed, Sir,” <lb/>said he, shivering with fear, “I did not
          <lb/>mean to kill you: I only intended to <lb/>frighten your horse, so that he might <pb/>
          <lb/>throw you and bruise you a little.” In <lb/>the sequel, <persName>Orvaine</persName>
          learnt that this man <lb/>was <persName>Peerwell</persName>, who had procured a wooden
          <lb/>tube, closed at one end, with a small <lb/>hole in the centre, which he had filled
          <lb/>with gunpowder; this he had set fire to, <lb/>at the central aperture, by means of a
          <lb/>lighted cigar; and the intention of <persName>Peer- <lb break="no"/>well</persName>
          was, that the sudden light and ex- <lb break="no"/>plosion of the gunpowder, in the <seg

          the evening, should, as he <lb/>had confessed, affright the horse of <persName>Or- <lb
              break="no"/>vaine</persName>, and throw him to the ground. If <lb/>his neck should be
          broke, so much the <lb/>better in the desire of <persName>Peerwell</persName>.
            <persName>Bel- <lb break="no"/>main</persName> watched at a distance, to enjoy the
          <lb/>spectacle; and it has been seen that on <lb/>the failure of the stratagem, he made
          off <lb/>with the utmost <seg xml:id="a152" corresp="#n152">celerity.</seg><note
            xml:id="n152" corresp="#a152"><term style="font-style: italic">Celerity</term>:
            swiftness.</note> Unfortunately <lb/>for <persName>Peerwell’s</persName> contrivance, he
          was so <lb/>much confused and agitated, that he had <lb/>retained the open end of the
          rocket in <lb/>his hand, and when he put fire to it, in- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>stead of its exploding in the direction <lb/>towards
            <persName>Orvaine</persName>, it discharged itself upon
            <lb/><persName>Peerwell</persName>, who was terribly wounded in <lb/>the hand and arm.
            <persName>Richard</persName> would have <lb/>laughed heartily at the whole affair, had
          <lb/>the man’s wounds not required serious <lb/>and immediate attention. By the help of
          <lb/>a person passing, he conveyed <persName>Peerwell</persName>
          <lb/>to a surgeon’s shop, where he was taken <lb/>care of <seg xml:id="a153"

        </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Orvaine</persName> now hastened after the carriage, <lb/>which had by this time
          approached the <lb/>villa of <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>. <persName>Rosa</persName>
          began to <lb/>feel some uneasiness, when, on listening, <lb/>she could no longer hear the
          sound of his <lb/>horse’s feet. He soon came up, however, <lb/>in a full gallop, and was
          quite in time to <lb/>hand the ladies out of the coach. When <lb/>he recited the
          particulars of his adventure, <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName> commiserated the infatuated
            <persName>Peer- <lb break="no"/>well</persName>, and was sorry that she was even
          <lb/>innocently the cause of his unhappiness. </p>
        <pb/>
        <p> The period for the marriage of <persName>Orvaine</persName>
          <lb/>and <persName>Rosa</persName> was now at hand. On the <lb/>evening before the day
          appointed, <persName>Mr. <lb/>Fairlong</persName> took <persName>Richard</persName> aside,
          and told him <lb/>that he wished to obtain his consent to a <lb/>double wedding. The young
          man ap- <lb break="no"/>peared surprised. But <persName>Mr. Fairlong</persName> did
          <lb/>not keep him in <seg xml:id="a154" corresp="#n154">dubiety.</seg><note xml:id="n154"
            corresp="#a154"><term style="font-style: italic">Dubiety</term>: doubtfulness.</note> He
          said he was <lb/>a bachelor, with a large fortune, and he <lb/>did not know how he could
          dispose of <lb/>himself and his wealth better, than by <lb/>bestowing both upon the family
          of his <lb/>old benefactor. “And as your mother <lb/>has no reluctance to the match, I
          hope, <lb/><persName>Mr. Orvaine</persName>, you have none.” <persName>Richard</persName>
          <lb/>was transported. “Objection! my dear, <lb/>good friend, I shall be entirely happy.”
          <lb/>In short, all parties being satisfied, the <lb/>ceremonials were performed in the
          usual <lb/>sacred style; and the ordinations of na- <lb break="no"/>ture appeared to be
          complete in the happy <lb/>union of <persName>Rosa</persName> and
            <persName>Orvaine</persName>. In <persName>Mr. <pb/>
            <lb/>Fairlong</persName> the mother found an estimable <lb/>consort, and her children a
          liberal guar- <lb break="no"/>dian. </p>
        <p> The day after the nuptial rites, in the <lb/>height of a superb entertainment which
            <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> had given on the occa- <lb break="no"/>sion, a
          lady and gentleman were an0- <lb break="no"/>nounced by the name of <persName>Madame and
            <lb/>Monsieur Longpee</persName>, who entered the room <lb/>with great stateliness, and
          with a very <lb/>slow step paraded round and viewed the <lb/>company quite leisurely. The
          lady then <lb/>broke silence, and demanded to know <lb/>which of the company was
            <persName>Mrs. Char- <lb break="no"/>mion</persName>? at the same time, casting a sig-
            <lb break="no"/>nificant glance at her spouse, she said,
            <lb/>“<persName>Longpee</persName>! what are you about?” “O, <lb/>pardon!” cried he, and
          deliberately taking <lb/>a small spy-glass out of his pocket, he <lb/>levelled it at
          Madame, and began to hum <lb/>an air very soberly, every now and then, <lb/>as he gazed
          through the tube at his <lb/>“better half,” gently exclaiming, in a <pb/>
          <lb/>French accent, “<seg xml:id="a155" corresp="#n155"><term style="font-style: italic"
              >Charmante! Admirable! <lb/>Adorable!</term>”</seg><note xml:id="n155" corresp="#a155"

          inquired for <persName>Mrs. Char- <lb break="no"/>mion</persName>, that lady approached
          her, when the <lb/>former said, “I am your daughter, ma- <lb break="no"/>dam; just from
              <placeName><term style="font-style: italic">Lunnun</term></placeName>. An’t I
            <persName>Long- <lb break="no"/>pee</persName>?” “Certainly, my dear,” replied he,
          <lb/>still eyeing her. “I apprehend, madam,” <lb/>“there must be some mistake in the
          <lb/>case.” “No mistake, madam, at all,” <lb/>exclaimed a venerable figure, neatly ap- <lb
            break="no"/>parelled, advancing to <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>. <lb/>“My dear
          mistress!” and here he fell <lb/>upon his knees: “don’t you recollect
            <lb/><persName>Sol</persName>?” Here <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, examining
          <lb/>the countenance of the man, clearly re- <lb break="no"/>cognised the features of the
          Peruvian ser- <lb break="no"/>vant who had formerly resided in her <lb/>family at
            <placeName>St. Leonard’s</placeName>, and who was the <lb/>companion of her husband’s
          captivity. <pb/>
          <lb/> “<persName>Sol</persName>!” cried <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> with emo- <lb
            break="no"/>tion and hastily, “is this lady my daugh- <lb break="no"/>ter?” “I pledge my
          salvation for the <lb/>truth of it,” answered <persName>Sol</persName>. “My dear, <lb/>my
          long lost daughter!” exclaimed <persName>Mrs. <lb/>Charmion</persName>, clasping her in
          her arms. “O, <lb/>dear, Maa! you’ll smother me. Won’t <lb/>she,
            <persName>Longpee</persName>?” “Certainly!” replied <lb/>Monsieur, still gazing at his
          wife. The <lb/>company now collected round this sin- <lb break="no"/>gular pair, and
            <persName>Rosa</persName>, advancing towards <lb/>Madame, kindly took her by the hand,
          <lb/>congratulated her on being restored to so <lb/>excellent a mother, and expressed her
          <lb/>own satisfaction, at meeting at that par- <lb break="no"/>ticular moment, with one
          whom she <lb/>hoped she might be permitted to call <lb/>sister.
            <persName>Orvaine</persName> went up to <persName>Mr. Longpee</persName>, <lb/>took him
          by the hand, said he believed <lb/>they would find themselves a little related, <lb/>and
          was about to lead Monsieur aside to <lb/>converse with him: but he declared he <lb/>could

          to <persName>Ma- <pb/>
            <lb break="no"/>dame Longpee</persName>. “Ogle me pretty, you <lb/>rogue!” cried she,
          overhearing him. But <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> insisted on her newly
          <lb/>discovered daughter’s being seated near <lb/>her, and <persName>Longpee</persName>,
          thus disengaged from <lb/>his attendance on his spouse, was by <persName>Or- <lb
              break="no"/>vaine</persName> introduced to the company as the <lb/>son-in-law of
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>. This lady, <lb/>anxious to learn the story of her
          daughter’s <lb/>life, and of her husband’s fate, solicited her <lb/>to narrate it; but
          this she did, at the very <lb/>outset, in so affected a manner, that her <lb/>mother
          concluded it would be the best <lb/>way to obtain the narrative from the Pe- <lb
            break="no"/>ruvian. <persName>Sol</persName>, who was still in the room, <lb/>was now
          requested to state the particulars <lb/>of his adventures since he had left <placeName>St.
            <lb/>Leonard’s</placeName>, which he did with great ac- <lb break="no"/>curacy,
            <persName>Mrs. Longpee</persName> declaring it would <lb/>kill her to tell so tedious a
          story. <persName>Sol</persName> de- <lb break="no"/>scribed the death of his master, the
          <lb/>adoption and education of the daughter <lb/>by the English lady, and his own subse- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>quent departure for <placeName>South America</placeName>. Here
            <lb/><persName>Monsieur Longpee</persName>, who had now joined <lb/><persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName> with <persName>Orvaine</persName>, took up <lb/>the history, and
          described that he had <lb/>arrived in <placeName>London</placeName> on business, that he
          <lb/>had accidentally seen <persName>Miss Charmion</persName>, <lb/>with whom he had
          fallen violently in love; <lb/>that he had made out to visit her, not- <lb break="no"
          />withstanding the vigilance and hostility <lb/>of her adopting mother; and, in a little
          <lb/>time had engaged her affections and mar- <lb break="no"/>ried her, in defiance of the
          English lady, <lb/>who in consequence had entirely with- <lb break="no"/>drawn her
          protection from his wife, and <lb/>settled her fortune upon another person; <lb/>a
          circumstance which <persName>Mr. Longpee</persName> said <lb/>he did not at all regret, as
          he had himself <lb/>a <seg xml:id="a157" corresp="#n157">competency,</seg><note
            xml:id="n157" corresp="#a157"><term style="font-style: italic">Competency</term>: a

          was the name of <persName>Madame Long- <lb break="no"/>pee</persName>,) who, with some few
          exceptions, <lb/>he truly believed to be the best woman <lb/>in the world. “Admire me
          pretty, you <lb/>rogue!” cried his lady, as he concluded. <pb/>
          <lb/><persName>Monsieur Longpee</persName> drew forth his glass <lb/>again immediately,
          and begun to espy her <lb/>as before, which he said he did, in obe- <lb break="no"/>dience
          to his wife’s desire, who had long <lb/>complained of his want of admiration of <lb/>her,
          until he had fallen upon this device. <lb/><persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> begged her
          daughter to <lb/>dispense with this mode of showing his <lb/>devotion, as it was totally
          repugnant to <lb/>the custom and etiquette of the country. <lb/>“La! Maa; why you <emph
            style="font­-style: italic">knows</emph> nothing of <lb/><placeName><emph
              style="font­-style: italic">Lunnun</emph></placeName>.” “But, my dear child,” re- <lb
            break="no"/>plied <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> with a benevolent <lb/>smile, “we
          know something of common <lb/>sense.” It was with sorrow that <persName>Mrs.
            <lb/>Charmion</persName> perceived that her daughter <lb/>had been spoiled by an English
          educa- <lb break="no"/>tion; but she hoped, although her man- <lb break="no"/>ners had
          been barbarized by the fashion- <lb break="no"/>able savages of
            <placeName>London</placeName>, that her heart <lb/>was not corrupted with false
          sentiment. <lb/>During the narrative by the Peruvian, <lb/><persName>Mrs.
            Charmion</persName> occasionally shed tears: <pb/>
          <lb/>but the present was not a time for sorrow; <lb/>and <persName>Rosa</persName> and
            <persName>Orvaine</persName>, and all the friends <lb/>of that lady, exerted themselves
          to chase <lb/>from her mind the unpleasant images <lb/>which began to intrude themselves
          there. </p>
        <p>
          <persName>Mr. Derwent</persName>, who was present and <lb/>witnessed all that passed, was
          observed <lb/>to put on a melancholy aspect the mo- <lb break="no"/>ment
            <persName>Longpee’s</persName> name was announced. <lb/>After the agitation excited by
          the disco- <lb break="no"/>very of <persName>Sol</persName> and <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion’s</persName> daugh- <lb break="no"/>ter, he went up to <persName>Mr.
            Longpee</persName> and <lb/>requested permission to speak with him <lb/>in an adjoining
          room, which being grant- <lb break="no"/>ed, they retired, and soon after returned,
            <lb/><persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> introducing <persName>Mr. Longpee</persName>
          <lb/>as his son. This created universal as- <lb break="no"/>tonishment; and every one
          present be- <lb break="no"/>came anxious; to hear an explanation; <lb/>but <persName>Mr.
            Derwent</persName> solicited them to spare <lb/>him the recital, nor impel him to open
          <lb/>afresh wounds which time had healed. <lb/><persName>Mr. Derwent</persName> was so
          much respected, <pb/>
          <lb/>that nobody doubted his veracity; and <lb/>his word was taken for a fact, which, to
          <lb/>establish it circumstantially, would have <lb/>required him to expose the infirmity
          of <lb/>a wife whom once he loved, but who had <lb/>eloped in his absence many years
          before, <lb/>when he resided in the island of <placeName>Barba- <lb break="no"
            />does</placeName>, with the <persName>Chevalier de Longpee</persName>, <lb/>taking with
          her an infant son, who was <lb/>now ascertained to be the husband of <lb/><persName>Mrs.
            Charmion’s</persName> daughter. <persName>Mrs. Der- <lb break="no"/>went</persName> had
          died in a distracted state of <lb/>mind at a convent in <placeName>France</placeName>, and
          the che- <lb break="no"/>valier, repenting of his crime, had, at his <lb/>death, given his
          whole fortune to young <lb/><persName>Derwent</persName>, who, unconscious of his legi-
            <lb break="no"/>timate name, had taken that of <persName>Longpee</persName>. <lb/>This
          young man, notwithstanding his <lb/>frivolities, (to which, indeed, he gave <lb/>way,
          merely to please his wife, who was <lb/>in raptures with French <seg xml:id="a158"

          foreseeing the approach of trouble- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>some times in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, had collected all <lb/>his
          fortune, vested a considerable portion <lb/>of it in French and English goods, and
          <lb/>embarked with his consort, (who was <lb/>anxious to learn something of her Ameri- <lb
            break="no"/>can connexions,) for <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, where he
          <lb/>intended to make an extensive commer- <lb break="no"/>cial establishment. </p>
        <p> The Peruvian had just left the room, <lb/>after having handed a letter to
            <persName>Rosa</persName>; <lb/>and all at once <persName>Orvaine</persName> perceived
          her <lb/>burst into tears. With the utmost agita- <lb break="no"/>tion he seized the
          letter, and had scarcely <lb/>ran his eye over a few lines, when his <lb/>beautiful bride
          fainted away. Every one <lb/>hurried to her assistance, and <persName>Orvaine</persName>,
          <lb/>dropping the letter, with trembling anxi- <lb break="no"/>ety took her in his arms,
          and conveyed <lb/>her to an open window, where having re- <lb break="no"/>covered a
          little, she desired to be suffered <lb/>to repose herself for a short time. <seg

          improvement and embellishment as <lb/>those of the natives of
            <placeName>Europe</placeName>; that, ac- <lb break="no"/>cordingly, he had removed with
          his <lb/>family after the war to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, <lb/>where the
          laws were liberal and enlight- <lb break="no"/>ened, and where he could educate his

          almost frustrated <pb/>
          <lb/>his intended experiment of actually pro- <lb break="no"/>ving the equality of the
          American mind <lb/>with that of <placeName>Europe</placeName>; but accidentally
          <lb/>coming to the knowledge of <persName>Mrs. Char- <lb break="no"/>mion’s</persName>
          residing in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, (he having <lb/>believed her dead,) and
          having heard her <lb/>universally celebrated for wealth and vir- <lb break="no"/>tue, and
          above all, for humanity, had, <lb/>after a terrible struggle with his con- <lb break="no"
          />science, determined, rather than abandon <lb/>his favourite project, to suppress the
          fact <lb/>of the child of his master being still <lb/>alive, to resort to a stratagem to
          place <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName> under <persName>Mrs. Charmion’s</persName>
          protection, <lb/>and had finally succeeded. That he had <lb/>rented a small tenement at no
          great dis- <lb break="no"/>tance from the villa, and had contrived <lb/>various ways to
          place <persName>Rosa</persName> in such a <lb/>situation as to excite <persName>Mrs.
            Charmion’s</persName>
          <lb/>attention, but had never been able to <lb/>succeed, until one morning the child had
          <lb/>offered that lady nosegays for sale, having <lb/>sent her out opportunely as
            <persName>Mrs. Char- <pb/>
            <lb break="no"/>mion’s</persName> carriage left her residence; that <lb/>the motive and
          design were unknown to <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName>, who had merely understood that
          <lb/>her father was an aged and poor military- <lb/>officer; that, with the assistance of
          an old <lb/>fellow-soldier, he had conveyed <persName>Rosa</persName> to <lb/>the spot
          where <persName>Mrs. Charmion’s</persName> servant <lb/>found her, (previously sending his
          wife <lb/>and his other children away, they having <lb/>started when he set out with
            <persName>Rosa</persName>,) leav- <lb break="no"/>ing fire in the house he had occupied,
          so <lb/>that it might be speedily consumed, and <lb/>render the circumstances of finding
          his <lb/>daughter more awful; that he had bound <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName> for the
          purpose of heightening <persName>Mrs. <lb/>Charmion’s</persName> compassion; that his
          fellow- <lb/>soldier had fired a double-barrelled gun <lb/>by his direction in order to
          attract some <lb/>of the servants to the spot, and that as <lb/>soon as he had heard
          footsteps approach- <lb break="no"/>ing, he flourished a sword, coated with <lb/><seg

              style="font-style: italic">Phosphorus</term>: an element giving off light.</note> in
          the air, which he pointed <lb/>to the exact spot where <persName>Rosa</persName> lay on
          the <pb/>
          <lb/>mattress, and thrust it partly into the earth; <lb/>that when he saw a person eagerly
          ap- <lb break="no"/>proaching he suddenly hid the blade of <lb/>the sword under his great
          coat, and ran <lb/>off in great haste, joining his assistant, <lb/>who had departed on
          firing the last gun. <lb/>For these artifices, the Peruvian in his <lb/>letter sincerely
          prayed forgiveness. He <lb/>further stated that all his little furniture <lb/>had been
          burnt; which, however, was <lb/>not of much importance, as he had, be- <lb break="no"
          />fore effecting his purpose, engaged him- <lb break="no"/>self as overseer to a gentleman
          who held <lb/>large possessions in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> near the <lb/>Bay
          shore, who was to supply him with <lb/>a furnished residence; that thither he had
          <lb/>sent his wife and family in a small coast- <lb break="no"/>ing schooner, waiting
          himself in <placeName>Balti- <lb break="no"/>more</placeName> till he had fully understood
          that <lb/><persName>Rosa</persName> had been adopted by <persName>Mrs. Char- <lb
              break="no"/>mion</persName>; that he had then followed his fa- <lb break="no"/>mily to
          the state of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and had <lb/>since been only once to
            <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> to in- <pb/>
          <lb break="no"/>quire after the fate of his daughter, who <lb/>had transcended his fondest
          expectations. <lb/>He also stated that a few days past, a boat <lb/>had put ashore at the
          place where he re- <lb break="no"/>sided, from a ship <seg xml:id="a162" corresp="#n162"
            >becalmed,</seg><note xml:id="n162" corresp="#a162"><term style="font-style: italic"
              >Becalmed</term>: motionless for want of wind.</note> for fresh <lb/>provisions; that
          he had gone on board <lb/>with a supply, and there seen <persName>Mrs. Char- <lb
              break="no"/>mion’s</persName> daughter, who, however, did not <lb/>know him; that he
          disclosed himself to <lb/>her, and after going on shore again to in- <lb break="no"/>form
          his wife, had come up to <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, <lb/>in order to establish the
          identity of <persName>Ma- <lb break="no"/>dame Longpee</persName>. </p>
        <p> On hearing these particulars, <persName>Mrs. <lb/>Charmion</persName> sent a servant
          immediately in <lb/>quest of the Peruvian; and he was over- <lb break="no"/>taken near
            <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, going off for fear of <lb/>punishment, or rather, from
          want of <lb/>courage to meet <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> under <lb/>the
          circumstances of the disclosure of <lb/><persName>Rosa’s</persName> parentage. It was with
          much dif- <lb break="no"/>ficulty he was brought back. But, on <lb/>his reaching the villa
          again, his fears were <pb/>
          <lb/>all dispelled, for <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName> gave <lb/>him to understand,
          that, although she de- <lb break="no"/>tested the character of an impostor, yet <lb/>that
            <persName>Rosa</persName> was too dear to her for her to <lb/>think of entertaining the
          least resentment <lb/>against her father. </p>
        <p> “And what says my dear <persName>Orvaine</persName>,” <lb/>sweetly asked
            <persName>Rosa</persName>, cheered at the gra- <lb break="no"/>cious condescension of
            <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>. <lb/>“Say, dear <persName>Rosa</persName>?” cried
          he: “why, <lb/>that I love and esteem you more than <lb/>ever. It is immaterial who are
          your pa- <lb break="no"/>rents, for I have espoused you only on <lb/>your own account. But
          surely, you are <lb/>nobly descended; and if I must be allied <lb/>to royalty, I confess I
          prefer the relation- <lb break="no"/>ship of the Incas, whose benevolent policy <lb/>of
          civilizing those whom they conquered, <lb/>ranks them high in the annals of kings.”
          <lb/>Smiling with joy, <persName>Rosa</persName> raised her head, <lb/>and was well again.
          The bridegroom <lb/>impressed upon her ruby lips a fervent <lb/>kiss, the seal to the
          sincerity of his pro- <lb break="no"/>fessions. </p>
        <pb/>
        <p>
          <persName>Mrs. Charmion</persName>, <persName>Rosa</persName>, and
            <persName>Orvaine</persName>, <lb/>accompanied by the Peruvian, returned <lb/>to the
          company, where the entire story <lb/>was disclosed, to the admiration of every
          <lb/>hearer. <persName>Rosa</persName> conversed for a long time <lb/>with her father,
          and, finally, such arrange- <lb break="no"/>ments were made as contributed to the
          <lb/>happiness of the whole connexion. <persName>Mrs. <lb/>Charmion</persName> agreed to
          bestow half of her <lb/>estate upon <persName>Rosa</persName>, who was still the child
          <lb/>of her heart; the other half was to go to <lb/>her own proper daughter at
            <persName>Mrs. Char- <lb break="no"/>mion’s</persName> death. The Peruvian was to bring
          <lb/>his family from <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and reside on <lb/>the villa lands;
            <persName>Mr. Longpee</persName> (or <persName>Der- <lb break="no"/>went</persName>) was
          to go into business at <placeName>Balti- <lb break="no"/>more</placeName>, supported by
            <persName>Mr. Derwent’s</persName> pa- <lb break="no"/>tronage and fortune; and
            <persName>Orvaine</persName>, after <lb/>spending a month with his friends in the
          <lb/>south, was to repair to <placeName>Boston</placeName> with the <lb/>lovely
            <persName>Rosa</persName>, and <persName>Mr. Fairlong</persName> and his <lb/>mother,
          and there prosecute his commer- <lb break="no"/>cial pursuits. In time, by associating in
          <lb/>rational company, <persName>Mr. Longpee</persName> and his <pb/>
          <lb/>spouse lost their English and French <lb/>oddities, and a lengthened duration of
          <lb/>happy days, and yearly visits continually <lb/>renewed, increased the delights of
          this <lb/>charming circle of relatives and friends, <lb/>and proved that Providence is
          always the <lb/>Guardian and Protector of virtuous hearts, <lb/>and that the uncorrupted
          manners of <lb/><placeName>America</placeName> are more favourable to happi- <lb
            break="no"/>ness than the frivolities of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, which <lb/>are
