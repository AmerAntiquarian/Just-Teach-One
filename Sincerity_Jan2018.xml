                  <lb break="no"/>duce to my happiness. You cannot be more certain of it,

                  <lb/>hemmed round with persuasive meddlers, who I am more 
                  <lb/>than half convinced, urged me to this measure, fearful I 
                  <lb/>should be burthensome to them; another thing, I was told

                  <lb/>gone; my health not sufficiently established to enable me to 
                  <lb/>undertake the journey I meditated before you left <placeName>England</placeName>; 
                  <lb/>my finances reduced to a very small portion, and though 
                  <lb/>most earnestly entreated to forbear, <persName>Darnley</persName> continuing his 
                  <lb/>visits. I found I must accede to his proposals, or be thrown 
                  <lb/>on the world, censured by my relations, robbed of my good 
                  <lb/>name, and being poor, open to the pursuits and insults of

                  <lb/>I might be tolerably happy in the union was—though my 
                  <lb/>heart felt no strong emotions in his favour, it was totally 
                  <lb/>free from all partiality towards any other. He always ap-
                  <lb break="no"/>peared good humoured and obliging; and though his mind 
                  <lb/>was not highly cultivated, I thought time might improve 
                  <lb/>him in that particular; however, I was candid with him; 
                  <lb/>told him the situation of my heart, and asked if he could be 
                  <lb/>content with receiving attentions which would be only the 
                  <lb/>result of principle. He seemed to think this only maiden-
                  <lb break="no"/>ish affectation, and perfectly convinced within himself that 
                  <lb/>I loved him already. I have read and heard much of the hi-
                  <lb break="no"/>larity of a wedding day. Oh, God! my dear <persName>Anne</persName>, when 
                  <lb/>my aunt entering my chamber told me it was time to rise, 
                  <lb/>my soul sunk within me, and like a condemned wretch 
                  <lb/>who hears the bell announce the last hour of his existence,

                  <lb/>what on its near approach seemed more terrible than death 
                  <lb/>itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My <persName>aunt Vernon</persName>, who had invited me to her house a 
                  <lb/>few days previous to the one which determined my fate; 
                  <lb/>and when she was convinced I should soon have a house of 
                  <lb/>my own, was very officious about dressing me; she observ-
                  <lb break="no"/>ed the languor of my looks, and the redness of my eyes, and 
                  <lb/>attempted to rally me; my spirits could not bear it. I burst 
                  <lb/>into tears, “oh why! why!” said I, in an agony, “have I 
                  <lb/>given my assent to a transaction which my better reason 
                  <lb/>disapproved. Aunt, dear aunt, indeed I do not love this 
                  <lb/>man; and I fear”—“Nonsense!” said she hastily, “you are 
                  <cb/>
                  <lb/>a silly romantic girl, you are too young yet to know any 
                  <lb/>thing about love; marry him first, you will learn to love 
                  <lb/>him afterwards” “But should I see one I may like better?”
                  <lb/>—Her look petrified me—“Impossible,” said she, “impos-
                  <lb break="no"/>sible, a woman whose passions are kept under the dominion 
                  <lb/>of reason, will never let a thought wander to another, when 
                  <lb/>once she is married, though she may not love her husband, 
                  <lb/>she will not love another.” “I am very ignorant in this 
                  <lb/>respect,” I replied, “and I hope God will enable me to do 
                  <lb/>my duty in the state I am about to enter.” I endeavored 
                  <lb/>to assume a tranquil appearance when I went down to 
                  <lb/>breakfast; <persName>Darnley</persName> was there; he rose, put a chair to the 
                  <lb/>breakfast table, seated himself beside me and took my hand. 
                  <lb/>Why my dear girl, said he, your hand is as cold as ice; it 
                  <lb/>is not colder than my heart, said I, and even now, <persName>Mr. 
                    <lb/>Darnley</persName>, I think you would consult your own happiness by 
                  <lb/>declining this union. I know better, said he, what will 
                  <lb/>promote my own happiness than you do; I love you, I 
                  <lb/>cannot live without you; and I will compel you to love 
                  <lb/>me; nay, you do love me now. A coach was at the door; 
                  <lb/>I strove to swallow a cup of tea; it was impossible; the 
                  <lb/>moment was arrived when I must dash at once into the tem-
                  <lb break="no"/>pestuous sea of wedlock; or recede and perish in the flames 
                  <lb/>of <seg xml:id="a006" corresp="#n006">calumny,</seg><note xml:id="n006" corresp="#a006"><term style="font-style: italic">Calumny</term>: false or defamatory statements; slanders.</note> reproach and <choice><orig>ignomy</orig><reg>ignominy</reg></choice>, that would burst upon 
                  <lb/>me from all sides. I rose hastily; <persName>Darnley</persName> led me to the 
                  <lb/>coach, my aunt and her daughter followed. At the church 
                  <lb/>we met two gentlemen and the <choice><orig>mother</orig><reg>father</reg></choice> of <persName>Darnley</persName>. I strove 
                  <lb/>to repress my emotions as I knelt before the altar; I pray-
                  <lb break="no"/>ed for grace to fulfil the duties which would be required of 
                  <lb/>me: Tears rose to my eyes; I endeavored to chace them 
                  <lb/>back to my swelling heart; I succeeded, but the conse-
                  <lb break="no"/>quence was worse than had I suffered them to flow; for 
                  <lb/>just as the clergyman pronounced us man and wife, my 
                  <lb/>nose gushed out with blood; my handkerchief and clothes 
                  <lb/>were suffused with the crimson torrent; it seemed to relieve 
                  <lb/>the poignancy of my feelings, for my temples had throbbed 
                  <lb/>violently, and my bosom seemed swollen almost to bursting. 
                  <lb/>I felt a faint sickishness come over me, but a glass of water 
                  <lb/>and the air prevented my appearing like a foolish affected 
                  <lb/>girl by fainting. The derangement of my dress obliged a 
                  <lb/>return to my <choice><orig>aunts</orig><reg>aunt’s</reg></choice>. When I got into my chamber I beg-
                  <lb break="no"/>ged to be left one hour to myself to compose my spirits. The 
                  <lb/>moment I found myself alone, I threw myself on my knees 
                  <lb/>by the bed side, and covering my face in the bed clothes
                  <lb/>gave a free vent to my tears. I cannot describe my feel-
                  <lb break="no"/>ings. I did not pray; I could not collect my thoughts. Oh! 
                  <lb/>that I could call back the last hour, said I—but I cannot, I 
                  <lb/>have vowed; I must, I will submit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The remainder of the day was spent at <seg xml:id="a007" corresp="#n007"><placeName>Windsor</placeName>;</seg><note xml:id="n007" corresp="#a007"><term style="font-style: italic"><placeName>Windsor</placeName></term>: a town on the <placeName>Thames</placeName>, just west of <placeName>London</placeName>.</note> when 
                  <lb/>we returned to town, an elegant supper was provided at 
                  <lb/><persName>Darnley’s</persName> own house, and I was placed at the head of 
                  <lb/>the table as its mistress. Henceforth it is my home. 
                  <lb/>I have not seen much company. I have been conside-

                  <lb break="no"/>ed; I was for a fortnight confined to my chamber; I 
                  <lb/>am now convalescent. <persName>Darnley</persName> loves society—I must not 
                  <lb/>make his house a dungeon—I will rouse myself from the le-
                  <lb break="no"/>thargic stupor which has for more than two months per-
                  <lb break="no"/>vaded every sense. I see I may be tolerably happy if I do 
                  <lb/>not wilfully shun the path that leads to peace. Perhaps, 
                  <lb/><persName>Anne</persName>, my heart was not formed to be agitated by those vio-
                  <lb break="no"/>lent emotions which some experience. It is probable the 
                  <lb/>passions so forcibly portrayed by the pen of the fabulist, dra-
                  <lb break="no"/>matist, or historian, are merely the children of romance, 
                  <lb/>and exist only in a heated imagination. You tell me you 
                  <lb/>shall not return to <placeName>England</placeName> until autumn. I anticipate the 
                  <lb/>moment of your return as the moment in which I shall 
                  <lb/>taste pure unmixed felicity. Adieu, my dear <persName>Anne</persName>, may 
                  <lb/>the pleasures that hover round your head and wait upon 
                  <lb/>your steps, be equal to the purity and integrity of your

                      <lb/>our little voyage across the channel, has made me anxious 
                      <lb/>to preserve the esteem of a person so amiable. I have no 
                      <lb/>doubt but <persName>Lady M * * * * * * d</persName>, will be more than satis-
                      <lb break="no"/>fied to have so capable a woman take the charge of her in-
                      <lb break="no"/>fant daughters. She must soon learn justly to appreciate 
                      <lb/>your value, and by every proper attention endeavour to se-
                      <lb break="no"/>cure to them as they advance in life, a continuance of your 
                      <lb/>valuable instructions enforced so powerfully by your 
                      <lb/>example. I will confess, dear madam, that I am so much 
                      <lb/>of an English woman, as to prefer my own country women, 
                      <lb/>in almost every respect; especially where the education of 
                      <lb/>the young mind is concerned, and where the future happi-
                      <lb break="no"/>ness and respectability of life depends greatly on the mor-
                      <lb break="no"/>als, manners and general habits of those with whom the 
                      <lb/>early period of youth is past. I am delighted with the vi-
                      <lb break="no"/>vacity of the French Ladies, I am convinced their 
                      <lb/>manners are more captivating than those of the English, but 
                      <lb/>while I have been charmed by their wit, almost fascinated by 
                      <lb/>the very high polish of their manners; I could not help 
                      <lb/>secretly wishing it had been tempered and corrected by the 
                      <lb/>modest <choice><orig>reserve. The</orig><reg>reserve, the</reg></choice> inobtrusive delicacy, which always 
                      <lb/>characterises a well bred English woman. You, my dear 
                      <lb/>madam, by a long residence abroad, have most agreeably 
                      <lb/>blended the vivacity of the one, with the chaste propriety 
                      <lb/>of the other, and your perfect knowledge of the French 
                      <lb/>and Italian languages, joined to an extensive knowledge of 
                      <lb/>your own, renders you a very able instructor in all. I pre-
                      <lb break="no"/>sume you will accompany the family to town after christ-
                      <lb break="no"/>mas, when I shall have an opportunity of renewing an ac-
                      <lb break="no"/>quaintance so pleasantly commenced, and which I trust will 
                      <lb/>ripen into a lasting friendship. But in the mean time, I 
                      <lb/>am not forgetful of your request to be informed of the prin-

                      <lb break="no"/>ject very freely, because there is no incident in her short 
                      <lb/>life, which she could wish concealed, and some that re-
                      <lb break="no"/>dound to her honor. I fear she is not happily marri-
                      <lb break="no"/>ed, but being of a disposition to bear all things with pa-
                      <lb break="no"/>tience, to look on the bright side of the picture, and not 
                      <lb/>think of an approaching storm, while there is one gleam of 
                      <lb/>sunshine left, I think it possible she may draw comfort from 
                      <lb/>various sources, which the irritable or discontented mind 
                      <lb/>would entirely overlook; and be more than content, where 
                      <lb/>another would be little less than wretched.

                      <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> is the daughter of a gentleman who held a 
                      <lb/>post under government which yielded him above a thous-
                      <lb break="no"/>and pounds per ann. She lost her mother at a very early 
                      <lb/>period, and her father’s household was conducted by a 
                      <lb/>maiden sister of her father’s, forbidding in her looks, rigid in 
                      <lb/>her principles, and harsh and unbending in her manners. 
                      <lb/>She had herself enjoyed little of the advantages of a polite 
                      <lb/>education, thinking and asserting at all times, that if a wo-
                      <lb break="no"/>man could read, write, execute various needlework, super-
                      <lb break="no"/>intend domestic arrangements, understood the etiquette of 
                      <lb/>the dining table, and drawing room, knew how to give eve-
                      <lb break="no"/>ry person their proper place, and pay them the proper 
                      <lb/>degree of respect due to their rank or wealth, <supplied>she</supplied> had attained 
                      <lb/>the summit of female excellence. Having no taste for 
                      <lb/>the fine arts herself, she treated as ridiculous every pur-
                      <lb break="no"/>suit of the kind, and as to a learned woman, she treated the 
                      <lb/>idea as a mere <seg xml:id="a013" corresp="#n013">chimera,</seg><note xml:id="n013" corresp="#a013"><term style="font-style: italic">Chimera</term>: an illusion.

                      <lb/>is an only child, she inherited from her mother a small pat-
                      <lb break="no"/>rimony, about 1500 pounds, it was in the funds, and the 
                      <lb/>interest would have been sufficient to keep her at a very 
                      <lb/>genteel school, but her father had an utter aversion to 
                      <lb/>schools, she was therefore attended by masters in all the 
                      <cb/>
                      <lb/>polite branches, her aunt documented her about economy, 
                      <lb/>sewing, flourishing muslin, &amp;c. &amp;c. but the larger part of her 
                      <lb/>time, (her father being engaged in business or pleasure, her 
                      <lb/>aunt in praying, scolding the servants, dressing and paying, 
                      <lb/>or receiving visits)—<persName>Sarah</persName> was left to amuse herself with 
                      <lb/>the servants, or read any books which her father’s library 
                      <lb/>afforded, or chance threw in her way, without any one to 
                      <lb/>direct her choice, or correct her taste. Possessed of an ar-
                      <lb break="no"/>dent imagination, it may easily be conceived that works 
                      <lb/>of fancy were read with uncommon pleasure; but this 
                      <lb/>was not the worst, she read books of religious controversy, 
                      <lb/>nor did the pernicious writings of fashionable sceptics es-
                      <lb break="no"/>cape. Her mind eager in the pursuit of information, em-
                      <lb break="no"/>braced it with avidity, in whatever shape it offered itself. 
                      <lb/>Nor is it surprising that from such a heterogeneous jumble, 
                      <lb/>her ideas became a chaos of romantic sensibility, enthusiast-
                      <lb break="no"/>ic superstition, and sceptical boldness; yes, contrary as 
                      <lb/>those sentiments are, they each in turn, predominated in 
                      <lb/>the mind of <persName>Sarah</persName>. Her father saw a great deal of com-
                      <lb break="no"/>pany, chiefly gentlemen. A girl sensible, witty, and with 
                      <lb/>an understanding uncommonly expanded for her age, in-
                      <lb break="no"/>troduced into the company of men, becomes early accustomed 
                      <lb/>to the delicious and intoxicating poison of adulation, and 
                      <lb/>too often falls a victim to the sentiments those flatterers 
                      <lb/>awaken in her soul, before reason and fixed principle

                      <lb/>of youthful passion. Had <persName>Sarah</persName> been of a temperature easi-
                      <lb break="no"/>ly called into action, she could not have escaped contamina-
                      <lb break="no"/>tion in the scenes to which she was too often a witness. 
                      <lb/>Her father was not a man of strict morals, he had sup-
                      <lb break="no"/>ported a woman as a mistress for many years, and was 
                      <lb/>frequently so imprudent as to take his daughter with him, 
                      <lb/>in his visits to this woman. But <persName>Sarah’s</persName> soul naturally re-
                      <lb break="no"/>volted at the approach of vice, and when she understood the 
                      <lb/>character of her father’s <seg xml:id="a015" corresp="#n015"><hi rend="italic">Chere amie</hi>,</seg><note xml:id="n015" corresp="#a015"><term style="font-style: italic">Chere amie</term>: literally dear friend. The use of French here is meant to politely signal sexual innuendo.</note> she resolutely refused 
                      <lb/>ever again to enter her house. Her aunt was so far service-
                      <lb break="no"/>able to her that she early inspired her with a love of vir-
                      <lb break="no"/>tue, and a veneration for religion, which I have no doubt 
                      <lb/>through her life, in spite of her excentricities, will ever be 
                      <lb/>the leading trait in her character. She was just turned of thir-
                      <lb break="no"/>teen when I became acquainted with her, and though there 
                      <lb/><choice><orig>was</orig><reg>were</reg></choice> seven years difference in our age, her sense was so ma-
                      <lb break="no"/>tured, her conversation so superior to the generality of 
                      <lb/>women, even at a more advanced period, that I courted 
                      <lb/>her friendship, obtained it, and found her tender, ardent, 
                      <lb/>and sincere, (if I may be allowed the expression,) even to a 
                      <lb/>fault. Totally unacquainted with the world, she believed 
                      <lb/>it to be such as the books she had read represented, she be-
                      <lb break="no"/>lieved every profession of love or regard made to her, and 
                      <lb/>would give her last farthing to relieve an object of 
                      <lb/>distress, without staying to enquire whether the distress 
                      <lb/>was feigned or real. I have said her father was dissipated, 
                      <lb/>he was, besides, thoughtless to a superlative degree in his 
                      <lb/>expenses, so, that when <persName>Sarah</persName> had reached her seventeenth 
                      <lb/>year, involved in debt, severely blamed by his friends, 
                      <lb/>and deserted by his dissolute companions, she saw him de-
                      <lb break="no"/>prived of his place, the duties of which he had for some 
                      <lb/>time scandalously neglected. About six months previous 
                      <lb/>to this deplorable change in her situation, <persName>Sarah</persName> had buri-
                      <lb break="no"/>ed her aunt, and when her father to avoid his creditors, 
                      <lb/>went off to <placeName>India</placeName>, she found herself cast unprotected on the 
                      <lb/>world, for having declared her resolution to liquidate the 
                      <lb/>most pressing of her father’s debts the moment she could 
                      <lb/>sell out money sufficient for the purpose; her relations de-
                      <lb break="no"/>clared their disapprobation of a conduct which they plainly 
                      <lb/>saw would leave her a very small stipend, and were cau-
                      <lb break="no"/>tious of inviting to their houses, a person likely to become 
                      <lb/>in some degree a burthen to them. I spoke to <persName>Sarah</persName> on 
                      <lb/>the subject, her answer was, “I am fully aware, <persName>Anne</persName>, 
                      <lb/>that no one can oblige me to pay these sums, and that by 
                      <lb/>retaining my little fortune, I shall be secure from dependen-
                      <lb break="no"/>cies; but one of my father’s creditors, is a poor tradesman, 
                      <lb/>who has a large family of children and a sick wife; another 
                      <lb/>is a widow, in very depressed circumstances; what right 
                      <lb/>have I to retain my fortune, while they, whose actual 
                      <lb/>property I have helped to waste, are driven to extreme neces-
                      <lb break="no"/>sity, while by paying them what is lawfully their due, I 
                      <lb/>restore them to a state of comparative comfort.” This ar-
                      <lb break="no"/>gument was unanswerable, I did not attempt to dissuade 
                      <lb/>her, she sold out a thousand pounds at a considerable 
                      <lb/>loss, paid those she thought were most in need of the money, 
                      <lb/>and remitted the remainder to her father. If you still feel 
                      <lb/>interested in my narrative, I will renew it in a short peri-
                      <lb break="no"/>od; but do not expect any romantic scenes, flaming lov-
                      <lb break="no"/>ers, or cruel false friends; what I have to relate, are inci-
                      <lb break="no"/>dents, perhaps, frequently to be met with in common life; 
                      <lb/>but I love Sarah, and all that concerns her is interesting to 
                      <lb/>me. Adieu, my dear madam.

                        <persName>Sarah</persName> having thus discharged those duties which the 
                        <lb/>strong sense she entertained of moral rectitude imposed on 
                        <lb/>her, she began to think of some method to enlarge her in-
                        <lb break="no"/>come by industry, and thus prevent her becoming trouble-
                        <lb break="no"/>some to her friends; I earnestly entreated her to live with 
                        <lb/>me, but in vain. “What is the reason,” said she, “that I 
                        <lb/>must not be allowed to support myself? Why should I be-
                        <lb break="no"/>come a charge to you? It is kind of you to offer it, but 
                        <lb/>what right have I to avail myself of your generosity? when 
                        <lb/>I have health and abilities to render myself independent. 
                        <lb/>You have a mother to support, and not the most plentiful 
                        <lb/>fortune to do it with; you have also a brother who can al-
                        <lb break="no"/>ways find employment for any little sums you have to 
                        <lb/>spare; continue to me those sentiments of esteem which it 
                        <lb/>has been my honor to excite, and my pride to endeavor 
                        <lb/>to deserve, and I shall be happier in eating the bread of in-
                        <lb break="no"/>dustry, than I could possibly be in dependent idleness.” 
                        <lb/>Her plan was to get recommended as a teacher in a board-
                        <lb break="no"/>ing school. Her aunt strongly opposed it—“I wonder, 
                        <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName>,” said she to her one day, “you have not more pride, 
                        <lb/>than to be willing to live in a state of servitude; I am a-
                        <lb break="no"/>shamed, I blush for your meanness of spirit.” “I should 
                        <lb/>have more cause to blush for myself, aunt,” she replied—
                        <lb/>“were I, with the education I have received, to become a 
                        <lb/>useless burthen to my friends. That is poor pride indeed, 
                        <lb/>which, to avoid active employment, sinks into a servile be-
                        <lb break="no"/>ing, and, to purchase the necessaries of life, must cringe to 
                        <lb/>a benefactor, take the lowest place in the room, never speak 
                        <lb/>but when spoken to, and be required to perform fifty meni-
                        <lb break="no"/>al offices, which, were that being in any other but a state 
                        <lb/>of dependence, would be rejected with disdain.” <persName>Mrs. 
                          <lb/>Vernon</persName> colored deeply, and Sarah was allowed to follow 
                        <lb/>her own plan. A young women, whose mind was so high-
                        <lb break="no"/>ly cultivated as <persName>Sarah’s</persName>, whose manners were so captivat-
                        <lb break="no"/>ing, and who had abilities to be so eminently useful, was 
                        <lb/>an acquisition to any school, and it proved that to the one 
                        <lb/>in which she engaged, she was so in a superlative degree. 
                        <lb/>The Governess was not possessed of many engaging quali-
                        <lb break="no"/>ties; she could speak French, and understood something of 
                        <lb/>the fashionable needlework; and these were the vast stock 
                        <lb/>of qualifications with which she presumed to take upon her-
                        <lb break="no"/>self the care and instruction of <hi rend="italic">young ladies</hi>. She had been 
                        <lb/>brought up in rather a low walk in life; had married a re-
                        <lb break="no"/>putable tradesman, and at the age of 45, was left a widow, 
                        <lb/>with very little provision, but a house full of handsome 
                        <lb/>furniture, for having been of an expensive turn, she had 
                        <lb/>found means to <seg xml:id="a017" corresp="#n017">dissipate</seg><note xml:id="n017" corresp="#a017"><term style="font-style: italic">Dissipate</term>: squander.</note> money as fast, and sometimes, faster, 
                        <lb/>than her husband could accumulate it. She had one daugh-
                        <lb break="no"/>ter rather more accomplished than her mother, for she 
                        <lb/>could play on the harpsichord, and make filligree. <persName>Mrs. 
                          <lb/>Harrop</persName> was advised to take a school; and as in seminaries 
                        <lb/>of this kind, the teachers have all the care and labor 
                        <lb/>while the Governess takes all the credit to herself; her want 
                        <lb/>of abilities, either natural or acquired, was no obstacle to 
                        <lb/>her following their counsel. They had been settled in a 
                        <lb/>very fine situation about five miles from <placeName>London</placeName>, nearly 
                        <lb/>three years, when having lost their head teacher by her ac-
                        <lb break="no"/>cepting a more advantageous offer; <persName>Mrs. Harrop</persName> heard of 
                        <lb/><persName>Sarah’s</persName> design, and having had her character very <choice><orig>favourably</orig><reg>favora-
                          <lb break="no"/>bly</reg></choice> represented by a gentleman who was intimate in her 
                        <lb/>father’s family, she made application to her to take the su-
                        <lb break="no"/>perintendance of the school. Her offers were liberal, and 
                        <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName> having consulted me, determined to wait on the la-
                        <lb break="no"/>dy, to settle preliminaries; and I fearing my young enthu-
                        <lb break="no"/>siastic friend would engage to perform more than her 
                        <lb/>strength would support, resolved to accompany her. This 
                        <lb/>visit produced some singular circumstances, and indeed, as 
                        <lb/>things have terminated, may be termed the great period 
                        <lb/>which gave the coloring to my dear <persName>Sarah’s</persName> future life. 
                        <lb/>You have observed the dignity of <persName>Sarah’s</persName> carriage, at that 
                        <lb/>period it was more conspicuous than it is at present<choice><orig>, at</orig><reg>. At</reg></choice> 
                        <lb/>times when she supposed herself not treated with proper 
                        <lb/>respect by those whose wealth or situation in life gave 
                        <lb/>them a fancied superiority, it would rise into something 
                        <cb/>
                        <lb/>like <seg xml:id="a018" corresp="#n018"><hi rend="italic">hauteur</hi>;</seg><note xml:id="n018" corresp="#a018"><term style="font-style: italic">Hauteur</term>: disdainful pride, haughtiness.</note> but to her equals she was ever affable, and to her 
                        <lb/>inferiors, her manners were so sweetly conciliating, that 
                        <lb/>while they forgot the disparity custom and education made 
                        <lb/>between them; the affectionate respect her conduct in-
                        <lb break="no"/>spired, never permitted them to treat her with improper fa-
                        <lb break="no"/>miliarity. Her dress was always the habit of a woman of 
                        <lb/>fashion, without the smallest affectation of finery. As I 
                        <lb/>knew to visit a school during the hours of study must be 
                        <lb/>an interruption, I ordered it so as to arrive at <persName>Mrs. Har-
                          <lb break="no"/>rop’s</persName>, about twelve o’clock. <persName>Miss Julia</persName> received us with a 
                        <lb/>profusion of civility, we were conveyed thither in a hand-
                        <lb break="no"/>some job coach, and I made my own foot boy mount be-
                        <lb break="no"/>hind, being aware how much first appearances strike, so 
                        <lb/>much so, that frequently the impressions made on a first in-
                        <lb break="no"/>terview, are never after entirely effaced. The young lady hav-
                        <lb break="no"/>ing ushered us into the drawing room, with many obsequi-
                        <lb break="no"/>ous courtesies, requested to be honored with our commands; 
                        <lb/>I perceived her mistake, and simply replied we wished to 
                        <lb/>speak with <persName>Mrs. Harrop</persName> on particular business. She im-
                        <lb break="no"/>mediately rose, and said she would inform her mamma, who 
                        <lb/>would come to receive our orders, and left the room. I 
                        <lb/>laughed, <persName>Sarah</persName> smiled, and observed, that she was won-
                        <lb break="no"/>drous polite. Yes, my dear, said I, a great deal more so, 
                        <lb/>than she would have been, had she guessed the nature of 
                        <lb/>our business. Here we were interrupted by the rustling of 
                        <lb/>silk, and <persName>Madam <seg xml:id="a019" corresp="#n019"><hi rend="italic">la <choice><orig>Govenante</orig><reg>Governante</reg></choice></hi></seg><note xml:id="n019" corresp="#a019"><term style="font-style: italic">la Governante</term>: the governess.</note></persName> entered in all the consequence

                        <lb/>gauze, wire, pompoons, and ribbon, strove for pre-eminence. 
                        <lb/>She was a tall, masculine figure, dark complexioned, her 
                        <lb/>cheeks just lightly tinged with best vegetable rouge, large 
                        <lb/>black eyes, and very strong brows of the same color, 
                        <lb/>which met over her nose, which was inclined to the aqui-
                        <lb break="no"/>line. “Pray be seated, ladies,” said she, seating herself at 
                        <lb/>the same time, “I am extremely honored by this visit, 
                        <lb/>and I hope, upon the inspection of the work, &amp;c. that has 
                        <lb/>been executed in the school, you will be so far satisfied, as 
                        <lb/>to give me the preference, in the placing any young lady 
                        <lb/>from home for the purpose of education. To be sure, I 
                        <lb/>have unfortunately lost my head teacher, but I have great 
                        <lb/>hope of having her place supplied by a young person, who 
                        <lb/>has been strongly recommended as a young woman of 
                        <lb/>taste, genius, and respectability; for you know, ladies, we 
                        <lb/>cannot be too cautious who we engage in such a situation.” 
                        <lb/>I perceived the vermilion of <persName>Sarah’s</persName> complexion begin to 
                        <lb/>heighten, so interrupted the loquacious governess with, 
                        <lb/>“True, madam, and I flatter myself my friend, <persName>Miss <choice><orig>Osborne</orig><reg>Osborn</reg></choice></persName> 
                        <lb/>here, will do honor to those who spoke so favora-
                        <lb break="no"/>bly of her.” The broad face of <persName>Mrs. Harrop</persName> now resem-
                        <lb break="no"/>bled the tints of a full blown <seg xml:id="a021" corresp="#n021">pioni.</seg><note xml:id="n021" corresp="#a021"><term style="font-style: italic">Pioni</term>: peony.</note> “Madam,” said she, 
                        <lb/>“did I understand you—this the young—.” “Yes, 
                        <lb/><choice><orig>Madam</orig><reg>madam</reg></choice>,” said <persName>Sarah</persName>, bowing with composure and dignity, 
                        <lb/>“I am the young person to whom you addressed this letter; 
                        <lb/>I feel myself competent to the business therein mentioned, 
                        <lb/>and shall only add, that if I engage in the situation, I shall 
                        <lb/>strive to discharge my duty conscientiously.” “Upon my 
                        <lb/>word, well to be sure, I thought,” said the confused lady, 
                        <lb/>then rising hastily, she rung the bell, and then seating her-
                        <lb break="no"/>self familiarly on the sofa, between <persName>Sarah</persName> and myself—
                        <lb/>“I dare say, my dear,” she continued addressing <persName>Sarah</persName>, 
                        <lb/>“you will do very well; <persName>Mr. Lewis</persName> said, you had a great deal 
                        <lb/>of taste, was patient and good natured.” “I am so, I trust, 
                        <lb/><choice><orig>Madam</orig><reg>madam</reg></choice>,” said <persName>Sarah</persName>, colouring, “when not imposed on.” 
                        <lb/>“Certainly, no one likes to be imposed on,” said <persName>Mrs. Har-
                          <lb break="no"/>rop</persName>, a little disconcerted by the firmness of her reply; a 
                        <lb/>servant just then entering, relieved her—”Bid <persName>Miss Julia</persName> 
                        <lb/>send some of the work and painting into the back parlor; 
                        <lb/>we’ll go down, child, and you can judge if you think you 
                        <lb/>can teach in the same manner.” But before this proposal 
                        <lb/>could be complied with, steps were heard ascending the 
                        <lb/>stairs. The door opened, and <persName>George Darnley</persName> and his mo-
                        <lb break="no"/>ther entered; <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> had a daughter at the school, 
                        <lb/>whom they had come to visit. I wished to converse 
                        <lb/>with <persName>Sarah</persName>, before she made any positive engagement, I made 
                        <lb/>a motion to go. “We will see you again in the evening, 
                        <lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrop</persName>,” said I. “Permit me, ladies,” said <persName>Darnley</persName>, 
                        <lb/>with a respectful bow, “to call up your carriage, and do 
                        <lb/>me the honor,” presenting his hand to <persName>Sarah</persName>! she accept-
                        <lb break="no"/>ed it, and with a slight courtesy to the Governess; and 
                        <lb/>one more respectful to <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, tripped down stairs, 
                        <lb/>and left <persName>Mrs. Harrop</persName> to explain to her visitor, who and 
                        <lb/>what she was, at her leisure. Are you weary? No—you 
                        <lb/>say! well, but really I am—so peace be with you, until the 
                        <lb/>next post.

                A PRETTY good period of time, you say, I have taken, 
                <lb/>before I bring <persName>Miss Osborn</persName> back to <persName>Mrs. Harrop’s</persName>, though 
                <lb/>I only left that lady to take a few hours ride with my little 
                <lb/>friend. Well, I hate apologies when a person from eith-
                <lb break="no"/>er inclination or necessity, has been remiss in a correspon-
                <lb break="no"/>dence; where indeed is the use of them? If inclination 
                <lb/>caused the silence, the excuses will appear forced and awk-
                <lb break="no"/>ward; if necessity has occasioned it, we must have but a ve-
                <lb break="no"/>ry poor opinion of the friend who would need an apology 
                <lb/>for what they must know is as painful to ourselves as to 
                <lb/>them; this, by way of preamble—and now to proceed 
                <lb/>with my narrative.
              </p>
              <p>
                When young <persName>Darnley</persName> had handed <persName>Sarah</persName> into the car-
                <lb break="no"/>riage, the bow of profound respect which accompanied the 
                <lb/>action; and the fixed attitude in which he remained on 
                <lb/>the steps of the door, until the carriage drove off, occasion-
                <lb break="no"/>ed me to smile, and ask her if she knew the gentleman? 
                <lb/>and if she did not think him handsome? “I am sure I 
                <lb/>don’t know,” answered she gravely, “whether he is hand-
                <lb break="no"/>some or ugly; I never saw him before, and have no wish 
                <lb/>ever to see him again.” —-“I am much mistaken, <persName>Sarah</persName>,” 
                <lb/>said I, “if he is quite so indifferent in regard to seeing you 
                <lb/>again.” “Do not let us talk like a couple of girls,” said 
                <lb/>she, with a half smile, “who never received the smallest de-
                <lb break="no"/>gree of polite attention from a man in their lives before.” —-
                <lb/>She then turned the conversation upon <persName>Mrs. Harrop</persName>, <persName>Miss 
                  <lb/>Julia</persName>, the work, &amp;c. “I am much deceived,” said she, “if 
                <lb/>I do not shew them some work and painting, at the end of 
                <lb/>the next term, superior to the daubs she so ostentatiously 
                <lb/>displayed: the work is very well, but there is a want of 
                <lb/>taste in the arrangement of the colors, the flowers want 
                <lb/>that lightness which is the greatest beauty of needlework.”
              </p>
              <p>
                I then gave her the necessary hints for not engaging to 
                <lb/>perform more than her strength would admit; she repli-
                <lb break="no"/>ed, “that if she was paid for her time, it would become a 
                <lb/>duty not to waste a moment, but to fill it up assiduously for 
                <lb/>the benefit of her employer.” We dined with a friend, 
                <lb/>and in the evening returned to <persName>Mrs. Harrop’s</persName>, made the 
                <lb/>necessary arrangements, and it was agreed that <persName>Sarah</persName> 
                <lb/>should take her new situation on the Saturday following.
              </p>
              <p>
                She had not long superintended the school, before <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>Harrop</persName> discovered what a treasure she had got; the schol-
                <lb break="no"/>ars naturally attached themselves to her, especially those 
                <lb/>who had been accustomed to associate with well bred per-
                <lb break="no"/>sons; her manners were so gentle, yet commanding; her 
                <lb/>language and appearance, were so superior to the Gover-
                <lb break="no"/>ness and her daughter, that they loved, while they dared not 
                <lb/>disobey her. But this, while it enhanced her value, creat-
                <lb break="no"/>ed a kind of envy in the bosoms of both the mother and 
                <lb/><persName>Miss Julia</persName>, which sometimes shewed itself unpleasantly; 
                <lb/>and when <persName>Sarah</persName> would give her opinion, which she often 
                <lb/>did, contrary to that of these ladies, a degree of fretfulness 
                <lb/>apparent in their answers, would evince their consciousness 
                <lb/>of her superiority; yet though they opposed her argu-
                <lb break="no"/>ments, they generally adopted her plans. During her resi-
                <lb break="no"/>dence here, she was frequently seen by <persName>George Darnley</persName>; 
                <lb/>his sister was extremely attached to her; his mother was 
                <lb/>pleased with her attentions to her daughter, and <persName>George</persName> 
                <lb/>himself fancied he was in love with her.
              </p>
              <p>
                <persName>George Darnley</persName> had in early life, been remarkable for 
                <lb/>the heaviness of his intellect, and the extreme difficulty 
                <lb/>with which he attained even useful acquirements. As he 
                <lb/>advanced toward manhood, he shewed a propensity for ex-
                <lb break="no"/>pensive pleasures, mixed with an unwillingness to procure 
                <lb/>them for himself; for dearly as he loved pleasure, he loved 
                <lb/>money better; every scene of amusement was joined with 
                <lb/>eagerness, if at the expense of another. Such a disposition 
                <lb/>was by no means likely to please <persName>Sarah</persName>; her chief plea-
                <lb break="no"/>sures were retired; she loved society, indeed, but did not of-
                <lb break="no"/>ten mix in it, because she could not often meet with such as 
                <lb/>afforded her satisfaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have mentioned that she had no brother. There was 
                <lb/>a young man whom <persName>Mr. Osborn</persName> had educated, and got in-
                <lb break="no"/>to the navy, by the name of <persName>Frederic Lewis</persName>; indeed, it 
                <lb/>was thought he was her natural brother, but of this her 
                <lb/>father never gave her any intimation. This young man 
                <lb/>felt all the fraternal love for her, which a man of sense 
                <lb/>might be supposed to feel for a sister like her; he thought 
                <lb/>her one of the most superior women the world afforded, 
                <lb/>and when on returning from a three year’s station in the 
                <lb/><placeName>West-Indies</placeName>, he found the great change which had taken 
                <lb/>place in <persName>Mr. Osborn’s</persName> family, saw his sister (for so he al-
                <lb break="no"/>ways called her) employed as a teacher in a boarding 
                <lb/>school—his sensations were poignant beyond description; 
                <lb/>but alas, <persName>Frederic</persName> was but a lieutenant, and what could he 
                <lb/>do? his pay was scarcely sufficient to support the appear-
                <lb break="no"/>ance of a gentleman; and <seg xml:id="a023" corresp="#n023">prize money</seg><note xml:id="n023" corresp="#a023"><term style="font-style: italic">Prize money</term>: The language here implies that <persName>Frederick</persName> is a lieutenant in the navy, and not a privateer—essentially a state-sponsored pirate—and thus only earns his regular pay for his service.

                EXACTLY what I apprehended, came to pass: <persName>Sarah</persName>, 
                <lb/>anxious to exert herself for the advantage of her employ-
                <lb break="no"/>ers, went beyond her strength, was constantly at her needle 
                <lb/>or pencil, when the cessation of school business might even 
                <lb/>have allowed her recreation. She uniformly declined vi-
                <lb break="no"/>siting any where, except now and then spending a day with 
                <lb/>me—-her aunt’s family pretending offence at her entering 
                <lb/>into what they termed a servile employment, were when-
                <lb break="no"/>ever she chanced to see them, cold and distant; it was not 
                <lb/>therefore likely that she could reap much satisfaction from 
                <lb/>visiting them; her other acquaintance had, some of them, 
                <lb/>chosen to forget her, and the rest treated her with a haugh-
                <lb break="no"/>ty familiarity, enquiring into the employments, and la-
                <lb break="no"/>menting the fatigues of her new situation, sometimes ming-
                <lb break="no"/>ling with these humiliating questions and observations, ob-
                <lb break="no"/>lique sarcasms on her father; which her high sense of filial 
                <lb/>duty could ill brook. This being the case, she frequently 
                <lb/>undertook the business of the other teacher, in order that 
                <lb/>she might reap the benefit of time, which to <persName>Sarah</persName> herself, 
                <lb/>was of no value; that is, of no value to be employed as 
                <lb/><supplied>usual with</supplied> persons in her situation usually employed. Such unweari-
                <lb break="no"/>ed application, added to little air, and less exercise; at least 
                <lb/>proper exercise, weakened a constitution not naturally ro-
                <lb break="no"/>bust, and extreme languor, difficulty of breathing, and a 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>hectic cough were symptoms too alarming to be beheld by 
                <lb/>me with indifference; but she herself treated them lightly, 
                <lb/>and would smiling say, “I am not sick, you want me to play 
                <lb/>the fine lady, which would be very unbecoming in a person 
                <lb/>in my station;” and when I have remonstrated, her reply 
                <lb/>would be, “Dear <persName>Ann</persName>, tell me where would be the loss of 
                <lb/>such an atom in creation as I am? Who would miss me, ex-
                <lb break="no"/>cept <persName>Frederic</persName> and yourself? And to your affectionate 
                <lb/>hearts I am only a source of constant anxiety. Unconnect-
                <lb break="no"/>ed in the world as I am, my early prospects clouded, my 
                <lb/>future ones dreary and comfortless, what is there to make 
                <lb/>me wish existence lengthened? Do not think me discontent-
                <lb break="no"/>ed, or quarrelling with life because the path I am to tread is 
                <lb/>not marked out exactly as I could wish it; no, I am very 
                <lb/>sensible that I enjoy many comforts, which thousands, more 
                <lb/>deserving than myself are deprived of; but feeling as I do, 
                <lb/>my desolate, unprotected state, though God forbid that I 
                <lb/>should by wilful neglect of my health, or any other means, 
                <lb/>hasten the moment of my release; yet I cannot form the 
                <lb/>smallest wish that its approach should be retarded.” <persName>Miss 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName> had, at her mother’s desire, invited <persName>Sarah</persName> to pass a 
                <lb/>few months with them at a small house they had at <seg xml:id="a025" corresp="#n025"><placeName>Turn-

                <lb break="no"/>dies at home under her inspection; but this, from the con-
                <lb break="no"/>sideration of young <persName>Darnley’s</persName> pointed assiduities, she posi-
                <lb break="no"/>tively, though politely, rejected; nor did I blame her.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among the many who visited the school, to inspect the 
                <lb/>improvement of pupils, whom they had placed there, was 
                <lb/><persName>Lady Bentley</persName>; she had two children sent from the <placeName>West-
                  <lb/>Indies</placeName> to her care, and having had some slight personal 
                <lb/>knowledge of <persName>Sarah Osborn</persName>, during her father’s prosperi-
                <lb break="no"/>ty, hearing that she was the principal teacher at <persName>Mrs. Har-
                  <lb break="no"/>rop’s</persName>, gave that school the preference. This amiable and 
                <lb/>worthy woman, saw with regret the visible alteration in 
                <lb/>her interesting countenance. “My dear young lady,” said 
                <lb/>she one day, when they were alone in the drawing room, 
                <lb/>“You are not well; I wish you had some situation that 
                <lb/>would be less fatiguing, and more congenial to your nature; 
                <lb/><persName>Sir James Bentley</persName> was well acquainted with your father, 
                <lb/>and regretted to me the other day that the daughter of his 
                <lb/>old friend, was not placed in some family of rank, where 
                <lb/>she might meet associates, such as she has been accustomed 
                <lb/>to, and be useful to society, by imparting her fine talents to 
                <lb/>two or three pupils at most, without, by incessant applica-
                <lb break="no"/>tion, endangering her health. Tell me, <persName>Miss Osborn</persName>, 
                <lb/>could such a situation be found, would it meet with your 
                <lb/>approbation?”
              </p>
              <p>
                This was addressing <persName>Sarah</persName>, in the style which was to lead 
                <lb/>her to whatever was desired. Tears started to her eyes, 
                <lb/>she acknowledged <persName>Lady Bentley’s</persName> goodness; the mention of 
                <lb/>her father’s name, accompanied with expressions of respect, 
                <lb/>was so soothing to her heart, that she readily agreed to do 
                <lb/>whatever might be thought necessary for the establishment 
                <lb/>of her health. A <persName>Mrs. Beaumont</persName>, a widow lady, with two 
                <lb/>daughters, one 12, and the other 14 years of age, was go-
                <lb break="no"/>ing for the winter to <seg xml:id="a026" corresp="#n026"><placeName>Bath</placeName>.</seg><note xml:id="n026" corresp="#a026"><term style="font-style: italic"><placeName>Bath</placeName></term>: A city in the South West of <placeName>England</placeName>, and famous for its spa baths which were constructed by the Romans in <date when="60">A.D. 60</date> and were long believed to have medicinal properties. <placeName>Bath</placeName> was an especially fashionable summer resort for the English elite in the eighteenth century.</note> <persName>Lady Bentley</persName> thought it would be 
                <lb/>the very thing for <persName>Sarah</persName>; the lady wanted a companion, who 
                <lb/>would ease her of the constant care she thought necessary to 
                <lb/>be paid to girls of the age of her daughters. To be with 
                <lb/>them at the hours when their masters attended them; walk 
                <lb/>with them, visit with them, read and work with them—
                <lb/>all which <persName>Mrs. Beaumont</persName> found it inconvenient to do her-
                <lb break="no"/>self, as (though not a dissipated woman) she kept a good 
                <lb/>deal of company, and the late hours of the preceding evening, 
                <lb/>often prevented her rising in time to superintend their 
                <lb/>morning studies, or accompany their morning rambles.
              </p>
              <p>
                She was a woman of a lively disposition, conciliating in 
                <lb/>her manners, perfectly well bred, and not likely to make a
                <lb/>ny person feel a state of dependence. She was introduc-
                <lb break="no"/>ed to <persName>Sarah</persName>, was charmed with her demeanor, and made 
                <lb/>her such offers, as were honorable to her own liberal na-
                <lb break="no"/>ture, and highly advantageous to my friend. <persName>Mrs. Har-
                  <lb break="no"/>rop</persName> was thunderstruck when she found <persName>Miss Osborn</persName> ac-
                <lb break="no"/>tually intended leaving her; yet she could not but be sen-
                <lb break="no"/>sible that her health required it. She strove to draw her 
                <lb/>into a promise to return to her in the spring, but this <persName>Sarah</persName> 
                <lb/>was too wise to accede to. Previous to her taking her jour-
                <lb break="no"/>ney, she spent three weeks with me, and <persName>Frederic</persName> being with us, 
                <lb/>the cheerful parties and excursions he was continually contriv-
                <lb break="no"/>ing, helped to restore a great portion of her health and cheerful-
                <lb break="no"/>ness. <persName>Mr. Lewis</persName> himself was much better pleased with his si-
                <lb break="no"/>ster’s situation; he had been with her on a morning visit to <persName>Mrs. 
                <lb/>Beaumont</persName>, and was satisfied, that she was a perfectly well 
                <lb/>bred woman; which to a person of a delicate mind, is one 
                <lb/>guarantee for happiness; for it is a certainty, no person ac-
                <lb break="no"/>customed to the forms of good breeding, and to that suav-
                <lb break="no"/>ity of manners, which is dictated by a polished understand-
                <lb break="no"/>ing, especially when accompanied by even the smallest 
                <lb/>portion of good nature, can be happy in the society of ill

                YOU are dissatisfied with my short letter, what can I say 
                <lb/>to fill a long one? I am in better health than when I left 
                <lb/><placeName>London</placeName>; <persName>Mrs. Beaumont</persName> is attentively polite, her daugh-
                <lb break="no"/>ters are pleasant children, and could I spend my time wholly 
                <lb/>with them, I should be extremely happy; yet, even as it is, 
                <lb/>I am far from being unhappy. I love company, but it must 
                <lb/>be the company of my equals; you will say, are not those 
                <lb/>with whom you associate so? Yes, but the generality of 
                <lb/>them, think themselves so vastly my superiors, and when 
                <lb/>they pay me any civility, let me know in such a pointed 
                <lb/>manner, that I owe their attentions entirely to my connec-

                <lb/>almost to reject their supercilious kindness. I have been to 
                <lb/>the rooms, I would gladly have been excused, but no apolo-
                <lb break="no"/>gies would be admitted. I was particularly careful that 
                <lb/>my dress should be as simple as possible; I never loved fine-
                <lb break="no"/>ry, and in my present circumstances, the smallest appearance 
                <lb/>of it, would be highly ridiculous; yet, simple as my appear-
                <lb break="no"/>ance was, I was unfortunate enough to attract attention. 
                <lb/>Now, could I find it in my heart to play the romantic girl, 
                <lb/>and write you the whole occurrences of the evening, tell you 
                <lb/>how elegantly I danced, and how finely I was compliment-
                <lb break="no"/>ed; describe the dresses of half the company, some from mem-
                <lb break="no"/>ory, and supply the rest by invention; tell you of the hand-
                <lb break="no"/>some men, and affected women; but I do so despise the 
                <lb/>general style of girlish letters, and hear them so often, and 
                <lb/>so deservedly ridiculed by men of understanding, that the 
                <lb/>very fear of having a letter of mine meet the eye of a man 
                <lb/>of discernment, will ever keep me from writing nonsense. 
                <lb/>Observe the compliment I pay myself, in supposing I can at 
                <lb/>any time write sense. <persName>Anne</persName>, last post brought me another 
                <lb/>letter besides your valued favor—that <persName>Darnley</persName>—what 
                <lb/>does he write for? I wish he would not trouble himself 
                <lb/>about me. Have you seen <persName>Frederic</persName> lately? When does 
                <lb/>he sail? dear worthy <persName>Frederic</persName>, how anxious he is about 
                <lb/>my health and ease, how gladly would he sacrifice all his 
                <lb/>little earnings to place me in what he calls independence, but 
                <lb/>his ideas and mine, on that subject, are different; while by 
                <lb/>any laudable exertion of my own, I avoided being a burthen 
                <lb/>to my friends, or a tax upon society in general—-I am, in 
                <lb/>my own opinion, perfectly independent. Last week, <persName>Mrs. Beau-
                  <lb break="no"/>mont</persName> went with a party to <seg xml:id="a028" corresp="#n028"><placeName>Clifton</placeName>,</seg><note xml:id="n028" corresp="#a028"><term style="font-style: italic"><placeName>Clifton</placeName></term>: A district in the city of <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, about thirty miles northwest of <placeName>Bath</placeName>.</note> and left me with my little 
                <lb/>companions, to pass the time as I pleased, and a delightful 
                <lb/>time I had. As soon as the morning lessons were over, I 
                <lb/>sallied out to the library, provided myself with a good 
                <lb/>quantity of books, in the instructive yet amusing style, and 
                <lb/>ordering a fire in my own apartment, took out my draw-
                <lb break="no"/>ing apparatus, and sat down to copy a beautiful landscape 
                <lb/>which I had transported from the drawing room for that 
                <lb/>purpose, while <persName>Eliza</persName> and <persName>Lucy</persName> read to me alternately. 
                <lb/>The day passed charmingly, we never left the room but to 
                <lb/>dine, and take tea, after which, music filled up the time till 
                <lb/>nine o’clock, when my companions retired to rest, and af-
                <lb break="no"/>ter an hour’s indulgence with <persName>Spenser’s</persName> <bibl>“Fairy Queen,”</bibl> I 
                  <lb/>followed their example. The next day, and the following, 
                  <lb/>we took long walks on the parade and the crescent, and I 
                  <lb/>will own, agreeable as <persName>Mrs. Beaumont</persName> is, I almost regret-
                  <lb break="no"/>ted when Saturday brought her home; for now we are 
                  <cb/>
                  <lb/>going on as usual, dressing, visiting, and turning night into 
                  <lb/>day; for though the public rooms are not allowed to keep 
                  <lb/>open later than twelve o’clock, yet there are constantly 
                  <lb/>large private parties. I have some suspicion that the gay 
                  <lb/>and amiable widow will ere long again enter the Hymeneal 
                  <lb/>pale, and that with a person much younger than herself. 
                  <lb/>Her kind friends sneer at the attentions he pays her, but 
                  <lb/>for my own part I do not wonder at the preference given her 
                  <lb/>by the men in general; her person still retains much fascina-
                  <lb break="no"/>tion, her face is handsome, her manners engaging, her un-
                  <lb break="no"/>derstanding highly cultivated, and her temper uncommonly 
                  <lb/>good. This is not the only professed admirer who dangles 
                  <lb/>after us to the theatre, dances attendance at the tea-table, 
                  <lb/>and lounges with us at the libraries and pump-rooms. A <persName>Sir 
                    <lb/>Watkin Alden</persName>, a baronet, young, rich, handsome, and a 
                  <lb/>libertine; I can see the title has no charms with <persName>Mrs. 
                    <lb/>Beaumont</persName>; the native unadorned merit of <persName>Mr. Frankly</persName> 
                  <lb/>has made a serious impression on her mind, and without 
                  <lb/>being what is called in love, I believe she is very sincerely 
                  <lb/>attached to him. —And now I am on this subject, I feel my-
                  <lb break="no"/>self impelled to mention a circumstance which has given 
                  <lb/>me some pain, because it has humbled me. This <persName>Sir Wat-
                    <lb break="no"/>kin</persName> has dared, shall I confess it, even to you, dear <persName>Anne</persName>? 
                  <lb/><choice><orig>whilst</orig><reg>Whilst</reg></choice> openly addressing <persName>Mrs Beaumont</persName>, to make profes-
                    <lb break="no"/>sions of love to your humiliated friend;and when my re-
                    <lb break="no"/>plies were such, as affronted delicacy and wounded honor 
                    <lb/>dictated, he laughed in my face, and asked me what I meant 
                    <lb/>to do with my pretty person, high breeding, and splendid 
                    <lb/>accomplishments? The men are not in haste to marry, ex-
                    <lb break="no"/>cept interest impels. “Oh that I were a man,” said I, and 
                    <lb/>my indignant passion so choked me that I could not utter 
                    <lb/>another syllable, and could with difficulty restrain my tears. 
                    <lb/>“Why, what would you do?” said he, catching my hands as I 
                    <lb/>was rising to quit the room—“Strike you to the earth, for 
                    <lb/>your base, your unmannerly conduct.” “Would you so, fair 
                    <lb/>tyrant?” cried he, insultingly. “But, my dear, if you were a 
                    <lb/>man, recollect, I should not give you this cause for an-
                    <lb break="no"/>ger.” “Wretch!” cried I, in a stifled voice, and wrenching 
                    <lb/>my hands from his grasp; in the exertion I made to disen-
                    <lb break="no"/>gage them, my right hand suddenly burst from his hold and 
                    <lb/>struck his face;—-the blow was not intentional, but it was 
                    <lb/>not a light one; his nose gushed out with blood.—I darted out 
                    <lb/>of the room, and left him to make what excuses he could to 
                    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Beaumont</persName>, whose footsteps I heard ascending the first 
                    <lb/>flight of stairs as I hastily ran up the second. This man’s 
                    <lb/>insolence has given such a wound to my sensibility, to my 
                    <lb/>pride, and self love, that the remembrance embitters all my 
                    <lb/>moments of retirement and reflection. What can I have 
                    <lb/>done or said, what action of my life can have given him 
                    <lb/>leave to hope he might succeed in his unworthy attempts 
                    <lb/>upon my honor? Heaven be praised, my heart is not made 
                    <lb/>of inflammable matter; it is a quiet rational kind of heart, 
                    <lb/>and has never yet fluttered at the fine speeches of a hand-
                    <lb break="no"/>some man, or bounded at the pressure of a hand, sending 
                    <lb/>its vital fluid to kiss the fingers which enfolded mine. Yet, 
                    <lb/>these are sensations I have heard described by others; have 
                    <lb/>read of in romances and novels. Perhaps you will say he might have 
                    <lb/>succeeded in awakening these emotions, had he proceeded 
                    <lb/>cautiously.—I do not think he would; I believe I have a 
                    <lb/>very sure guard against imbibing any foolish passion—I am 
                    <lb/>poor, <persName>Anne</persName>, but I am proud, very proud.—Oh, my full 
                    <lb/>heart!—Pardon my troubling you with this silly affair; but 
                    <lb/>it gave me pain, and I know you ever sympathize in the 
                    <lb/>pains and pleasures of your honored and obliged,

                YOU perceive by the letter I enclosed in my last, that 
                <lb/>my young friend’s situation was not entirely congenial to her 
                <lb/>feelings, though she would not complain. She says she is 
                <lb/>proud; it is true, she is so, but it is that kind of proper 
                <lb/>pride, which is the safeguard of female virtue. I heard 
                <lb/>from an acquaintance, who was at <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Bath</placeName></hi> at the period she 
                <lb/>was there, that she was an object of admiration, ill nature 
                <lb/>and envy. This you will say is a strange assertion, yet it 
                <lb/>was actually so. The simplicity and frankness of her man-
                <lb break="no"/>ner, the brilliancy of her understanding, and high cultiva-
                <lb break="no"/>tion of her talents, made her society courted by the men, 
                <lb/>and rendered her an object of general dislike to the wom-
                <lb break="no"/>en, for it is a humiliating circumstance to confess, that beau-
                <lb break="no"/>ty, wit and talents, are by no means possessions to secure a 
                <lb/>friend in our own sex. Why is this? Why do women suf-
                <lb break="no"/>fer that degrading quality envy, to predominate in their 
                <lb/>bosoms? Men naturally esteem those who are most wor-
                <lb break="no"/>thy esteem; to be brave, generous, learned, magnanimous, will 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>gain a man the respect, the veneration of all; his society 
                <lb/>is courted, his friendship thought an honor, even though 
                <lb/>his person should not be a perfect model of the <seg xml:id="a030" corresp="#n030"><hi rend="italic">Apollo Belvidere</hi>.</seg><note xml:id="n030" corresp="#a030"><term style="font-style: italic">Apollo Belvidere</term>: a celebrated marbled sculpture from Roman antiquity of the Greek god <persName>Apollo</persName>.

                And here is no particular sex aimed at, it is then the

                <lb/>they strive not themselves to acquire. But I am running 
                <lb/>from my subject. <persName>Sarah</persName> so far from being flattered by the 
                <lb/>attentions of the men, was, as she herself forcibly expresses 
                <lb/>it, humbled; the situation of her mind, together with the ir-
                <lb break="no"/>regular hours <persName>Mrs. Beaumont</persName> kept, rendered the medicinal 
                <lb/>virtues of the <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Bath</placeName></hi> waters of no effect. You may ask per-
                <lb break="no"/>haps why did she not decline parties so prejudicial to her 
                <lb/>health? She did on her first entering the family make an 
                <lb/>effort to that purpose, but <persName>Mrs. Beaumont</persName> who thought 
                <lb/>society necessary to amend the spirits of her young com-
                <lb break="no"/>panion, pressed so earnestly, that there was no opposing 
                <lb/>her desires without rudeness, and let her have been up ev-
                <lb break="no"/>er so late at night, she always rose in time to attend the 
                <lb/>young ladies at their lessons. In March they returned to 
                <lb/><hi rend="italic"><placeName>London</placeName></hi>. But I was shocked at the appearance of <persName>Sarah</persName>, ev-
                <lb break="no"/>ery bad symptom was evidently increased, and I was assur-
                <lb break="no"/>ed by a <choice><orig>Physician</orig><reg>physician</reg></choice> whom I had requested to call as by ac-
                <lb break="no"/>cident to see her, that nothing but quiet and regular living 
                <lb/>would have any chance of restoring her. <persName>Mrs. Beaumont</persName> 
                <lb/>was unwilling to part with her, said she should not be 
                <lb/>plagued with the children, she would send them to school. 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName> smiled. The dear children, madam, said she, are my 
                <lb/>comforts; I could not have remained with you so long, 
                <lb/>had not my heart been strongly drawn towards those inter-
                <lb break="no"/>esting young ladies. I am honored by your friendship, 
                <lb/>venerate and respect your virtues, am grateful for the many 
                <lb/><choice><orig>favours</orig><reg>favors</reg></choice> you have conferred on me, but neither my health, 
                <lb/>spirits, nor situation in life, render it proper for me to be 
                <lb/>continually mixing in scenes to which your rank 
                <lb/>make you familiar, and of which you are an ornament. 
                <lb/>And this fine flattering speech, replied <persName>Mrs. Beaumont</persName>, is 
                <lb/>to gild over the positive rejection of my proposal, and let 
                <lb/>me know as politely as possible, you are determined to leave 
                <lb/>me; well, I must submit, only believe me, should you ever 
                <lb/>want a friend, you will be sure to find one in me. When 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName> left this amiable woman, she presented her with an 
                <lb/>elegant pocket book, which on opening, was found to con-
                <lb break="no"/>tain a note of fifty guineas, together with a most affection-
                <lb break="no"/>ate letter, recommending her to a widow lady, who resid-

                <lb/>where she might enjoy pure air, quiet, and the exercise of 
                <lb/>walking, whenever she felt inclined, in a large garden. I 
                <lb/>should have insisted on her going with me on some tour of 
                <lb/>pleasure, but business of an important nature, obliged me 
                <lb/>to visit <hi rend="italic"><placeName>Paris</placeName></hi>, and the speed with which I was obliged to 
                <lb/>travel, as well as the length of the journey, made it im-
                <lb break="no"/>possible she should accompany me thither. The evening 
                <lb/>before my departure, I passed a few hours with her at her 
                <lb/>new habitation, and discovered that the old lady with 
                <lb/>whom she had taken up her abode, was a distant relation 
                <lb/>of the <persNamee>Darnley</persNamee> family. This was an unpleasant circum-
                <lb break="no"/>stance to <persName>Sarah</persName>, but she was every way else so comfortably 
                <lb/>accommodated, and reflecting wherever she was, <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName> would claim a right of visiting her, she made no 
                <lb/>attempt to remove. Whilst I was sitting with her, we 
                <lb/>were greatly surprised by the entrance of <persName>Frederic Lewis</persName>, 
                <lb/>who had returned unexpectedly from a cruise, and I left 
                <lb/>her in better spirits, than I otherwise should, from the idea 
                <lb/>that she had in him a proper and affectionate protector. 
                <lb/>His ship was coming up to <seg xml:id="a033" corresp="#n033"><hi rend="italic"><placeName>Deptford</placeName></hi>,</seg><note xml:id="n033" corresp="#a033"><term style="font-style: italic"><placeName>Deptford</placeName></term>: an area in <placeName>London</placeName> which until the late nineteenth century was home to the first <placeName>Royal Navy Dockyard</placeName>.</note> to undergo a thorough

                <lb break="no"/>ly lash and ridicule my follies, for it is my firm opinion, 
                <lb/><persName>Anne</persName>, that more than half the vices and follies with which 
                <lb/>this sublunary sphere so plentifully abounds, owe their or-
                <lb break="no"/>igin to the want of truth, in the intercourse between the 
                <lb/>animated atoms with which it is peopled; every vice that 
                <lb/>can disgrace humanity, is dignified with some specious 
                <lb/>name, and decorated with such tinsel finery, that it almost 
                <lb/>assumes the appearance of a virtue. Why can we not 
                <lb/>speak plain, openly avow the detestation we feel toward a 
                <lb/>deviation from rectitude, and treat profligacy of all kinds, 
                <lb/>with the contempt it deserves. But this is not proceeding 
                <lb/>in a direct line with the story I was about to commence; 
                <lb/>no matter, mariners say there is more pleasure in traverse 
                <lb/>sailing, when by dexterous management they reach in safe-
                <lb break="no"/>ty the intended port, than in proceeding in a straight 
                <lb/>course with the wind upon the beam.
              </p>
              <p>
                Last Monday evening, <persName>Darnley</persName> was gone to his club.—
                <lb/><persName>Ann</persName>, I don’t like these clubs; they smoke, drink and dis-
                <lb break="no"/>pute, until they fancy themselves statesmen, heroes, and 
                <lb/>demigods, and go home to their wives in a state little re-
                <lb break="no"/>moved from brutality; preach about the prerogative and 
                <lb/>dignity of man, the great lord of creation, and expect their 
                <lb/>simply rational companions to bow with submission, and 
                <lb/>acknowledge their supremacy.—Well, <persName>Darnley</persName>, was at his 
                <lb/>club. <persName>Mary Melbourn</persName> had past the evening with me; 
                <lb/>she is on a visit of two or three months to <persName>Darnley’s</persName> moth-
                <lb break="no"/>er, and having a bad head ache, had retired early. I had 
                <lb/>played until I was weary, and was sitting in a kind of list-
                <lb break="no"/>less half sleep and awake manner, when a single rap at the 
                <lb/>street door made me start; the servant, who was sitting up 
                <lb/>in the kitchen, ran to the door, but had the precaution to 
                <lb/>put the chain across before she opened it. “Does not <persName>Mr. 
                 <lb/>George Darnley</persName> live here?” said a faint female voice. 
                <lb/><persName>Betty</persName> replied in the affirmative. “Is he at home?” asked 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>the same voice. —“No,” she replied, “but my mistress is.” 
                <lb/>“Your mistress, what, Mr. Darnley’s mother?” “No, his 
                <lb/>wife,”— “His wife?” she exclaimed shrilly, and seemed chok-
                <lb break="no"/>ed with an hysteric affection,—then pausing a moment or 
                <lb/>two, she said,—“I am to blame—I have business of import-
                <lb break="no"/>ance, young woman, to transact with your master, pray 
                <lb/>give him this letter, and request him not to fail coming 
                <lb/>early in the morning, to the place I have mentioned, for I 
                <lb/>am come off a long journey, fatigued, ill, distressed, and 
                <lb/>can only look to him for comfort and repose.”—At every 
                <lb/>sentence the agitated female uttered, I had drawn nearer 
                <lb/>and nearer the head of the stairs, and when she had finish-
                <lb break="no"/>ed the last, was actually half way down, but before I could 
                <lb/>speak, she was gone, having left the letter in <placeName>Betty’s</placeName> hands. 
                <lb/>The girl met me on the stairs, and offered to give me the 
                <lb/>folded paper—that almost irresistible propensity which 
                <lb/>undid madam <persName>Eve</persName>, had nearly compelled me to take it; 
                <lb/>but before I had touched it I recalled my better reason. 
                <lb/>“Go,” said I, “put it in the card racks in your master’s 
                <lb/>counting house. I will go to bed,”—and I actually did go 
                <lb/>to bed, lest I might be tempted to pry into a letter which 
                <lb/>might be only on business, and in no way whatever con-
                <lb break="no"/>cern me. There was something strange in the woman’s 
                <lb/>coming at that hour of the night, for it was past ten 
                <lb/>o’clock; her voice, too, seemed the voice of wounded sen-
                <lb break="no"/>sibility. These reflections kept me waking, and when 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName> came home, I told him of the letter, and bade the 
                <lb/>maid bring it to him. I am interrupted.

                I WAS unable to restrain the inclination I felt to watch 
                <lb/>the countenance of <persName>Darnley</persName>, whilst he perused the letter; 
                <lb/>he appeared considerably agitated; he crumpled it up, and 
                <lb/>turning hastily to me, asked, “who brought this letter?”
                <lb/>“A woman.” “Did you see her?” “No, I did not, but if 
                <lb/>I could judge from the tone of her voice, she was in great 
                <lb/>distress.” “She is in great distress,” he replied. “I 
                <lb/>hope then, you will do what you can to serve her.” “You 
                <lb/>hope, <persName>Sarah</persName>?” “Yes, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>, are you surprised at 
                <lb/>my expressing an interest for an afflicted woman?” “No, 
                <lb/>but she is an entire stranger to you, and why should you 
                <lb/>wish or care about her?” “Only as a distressed fellow 
                <lb/>creature.” “Well, I shall think about her in the morning.” 
                <lb/>“And visit her, won’t you? She seemed very anxious to 
                <lb/>see you.” “Yes, and visit her, if you desire it.” I per-
                <lb break="no"/>ceived he was in one of those kind of humors, which only 
                <lb/>waits the opportunity of saying ill natured things, and is 
                <lb/>ready to catch and repeat every word, in order to cavil 
                <lb/>at it, so imagined I should shew most prudence in remain-
                <lb break="no"/>ing silent. You have never been married, <persName>Anne</persName>, so cannot 
                <lb/>inform me whether it is so or not, but if every married 
                <lb/>man is so captious, and petulant, so angry at their wives’ 
                <lb/>only expressing a difference in opinions in the mildest 
                <lb/>words: I wonder how any woman can be so passionately 
                <lb/>attached to them. But, perhaps, that passionate attach-
                <lb break="no"/>ment prevents their seeing any fault in them, and they, 
                <lb/>supposing all the men thus idolized, says, does, or thinks, is 
                <lb/>right, never take the trouble of contradicting him; assent 
                <lb/>implicitly to his opinions, however absurd, and will not 
                <lb/>exert their own mental powers to think or decide for them-
                <lb break="no"/>selves. Happy beings! but this is a kind of felicity in which 
                <lb/>I shall never be a partaker. Yet <persName>Darnley</persName> is not what the 
                <lb/>world calls an ill tempered man, nor of the lowest order in 
                <lb/>point of understanding; and heaven is my judge, I try to 
                <lb/>view every action, every word in the fairest point of view, 
                <lb/>and I really think if he was to take a different method from 
                <lb/>what he does, I should in time, teach my heart to feel for 
                <lb/>him every sentiment, which it is necessary to form a com-
                <lb break="no"/>plete system of permanent happiness, at least, as far as it 
                <lb/>depends on a mutual interchange of kind offices, and that 
                <lb/>solicitude to promote each other’s peace of mind, which 
                <lb/>ought to be constantly kept in view, by persons residing 
                <lb/>continually under the same roof, and destined to pass their 
                <lb/>lives together. But to return, I have reason to think that 
                <lb/>neither of us passed a very pleasant night. <persName>Darnley</persName> was 
                <lb/>restless, and slept little, sighed frequently, and seemed anx-
                <lb break="no"/>iously watching for day light, as he arose several times, 
                <lb/>and unclosed the shutter to look out; this being the case,
                <lb/>it cannot be supposed I rested very well; however, about 
                <lb/>four o’clock, I fell into a sound sleep, and on awaking at 
                <lb/>half past eight, found he was risen and gone out. I dressed 
                <lb/>hastily, that I might be ready for breakfast when he return-
                <lb break="no"/>ed: it was near ten o’clock when he came in. “Well,” 
                <lb/>said he, throwing his hat into a chair, “why have you 
                <lb/>waited breakfast? I have been to see <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>, and 
                <lb/>have breakfasted with her.” “Been to see who, cousin 
                <lb/><persName>George</persName>?” said <persName>Miss Melbourn</persName>, looking hastily up from a 
                <lb/>book, which she had been reading. “<persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>, my 
                <lb/>pretty Polly,” said he, facetiously chucking her under the 
                <lb/>chin, “you know she was formerly a flame of mine.” “So 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>the world said,” replied <persName>Mary</persName>, her face in a glow, and her 
                <lb/>large black eyes speaking a vast deal more than she per-
                <lb break="no"/>mitted her tongue to utter. “Well, cousin <persName>Mary</persName>, don’t 
                <lb/>you be jealous, if my wife gives me leave to visit an old 
                <lb/>sweetheart, surely you will not forbid me, and upon my 
                <lb/>honor, the last words she said to me last night, was to de-
                <lb break="no"/>sire me to visit <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> early.” “And I am very 
                <lb/>glad, my dear,” said I, “you obeyed my commands; and 
                <lb/>though you have breakfasted with her, seeing you are in 
                <lb/>such an obedient humor, I command you now to sit down 
                <lb/>and breakfast again with me.” He sat down, and took up 
                <lb/>the newspaper. I did not intend to have said a word more 
                <lb/>concerning the letter or lady, I felt no uneasiness; if she 
                <lb/>had once been a favorite, he had given a positive proof 
                <lb/>that I had been preferred, and why should I teaze him with

                <lb break="no"/>fection, however it may be thought a proof of the wife’s 
                <lb/>love, pays the husband’s integrity, a very ill compliment. 
                <lb/>But <persName>Mary Melbourn</persName> could not let the matter rest. “How 
                <lb/>long has <persName>Mrs.Romain</persName> been in town?” said she, addressing 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName>. “She arrived late last night from <placeName>Dover</placeName>.” “I 
                <lb/>heard she was gone to be a boarder in the convent of <seg xml:id="a039" corresp="#n039"><placeName>St.

A popular, and scandalous, gothic novel entitled <bibl style="font­-style: italic">Confessions of the Nun of St. Omer</bibl> (<date when="1805">1805</date>) was published by <persName>Charlotte Dacre</persName>, writing as “<persName>Rosa Matilda</persName>,” and its plot features a heroine who is abandoned by her father and becomes (due to the influence of <persName>Rousseau</persName>) a hopeless romantic with little regard for the sanctity of marriage. While <persName>Dacre’s</persName> novel appears two years after the serialization of <bibl style="font­-style: italic">Sincerity</bibl>, the similar use of <placeName>St. Omers</placeName> as a marker of sexually profligate women evinces both the anti-Catholicism of the era and the common Anglo-American trope of figuring French characters (or characters who were educated in <placeName>Francevo</placeName>) as having a more lax moral code than their British counterparts.</note> “So she was, but her husband is lately dead, she

                <lb/>had better have remained where she was; I never saw her 
                <lb/>but once in my life, I was not then pleased with her, and 
                <lb/>from what the world has said, I think the more I had known 
                <lb/>her the less I should have liked her.” “I do believe, <persName>Sarah</persName>,” 
                <lb/>said he, turning laughing towards me “our cousin <persName>Mary</persName>

                <lb/>her late husband’s effects.” “I have nothing to say to it,” 
                <lb/>said she, “if <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> has no objection to such a com-
                <lb break="no"/>panion, it can be no business of mine; besides, I return to 
                <lb/>your mother’s today, and leave town on Saturday.” “So 
                <lb/>soon?” said he, carelessly. “Yes,” was the reply, and the 
                <lb/>subject was dropped. When she had finished her breakfast, 
                <lb/>I told <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>, that I hoped he had not from my si-
                <lb break="no"/>lence imagined I should not be glad to receive any person 
                <lb/>he should think proper to invite to his house; and would, 
                <lb/>if he thought it necessary, wait on the lady in question, and 
                <lb/>second his invitation, as without that, she might be unwil-
                <lb break="no"/>ling to avail herself of it.” “Will you be so very good, 
                <lb/>my kind hearted <persName>Sarah</persName>?” said he; “it will indeed gratify 
                <lb/>me very much; she is a distressed woman, has been calum-
                <lb break="no"/>niated by the world, and ill treated by her husband’s rela-
                <lb break="no"/>tions, who are endeavoring to wrest the little property her 
                <lb/>husband left, from her and her infant daughter, in order to 
                <lb/>secure it to her son, whom they have taken from her. Your 
                <lb/>countenancing her, will give her an air of respectability, 
                <lb/>and restore her to that rank in society, from which she has unjust-
                <lb break="no"/>ly been driven by the ill nature and jealousy of a brutal 
                <lb/>husband.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “I think, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>,” said I, “that the respect due 
                <lb/>to your own honor, will prevent your wishing to associate 
                <lb/>your wife with a person whose good name had been tar-
                <lb break="no"/>nished by any wilful act of guilt; in that confidence I shall 
                <lb/>cheerfully do what seems to be so agreeable to your wish-
                <lb break="no"/>es; if you will accompany me at twelve o’clock, I will pay 
                <lb/>the proposed visit, and while I see no cause to think <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>Romain</persName> guilty or imprudent, every mark, every office of 
                <lb/>kindness in my power, I shall be happy to shew her.”
              </p>
              <p>
                When I went up stairs to arrange my dress, <persName>Mary</persName> tap-
                  <lb break="no"/>ped at the dressing-room door; when she entered, I per-
                <lb break="no"/>ceived that her eyes were red with weeping. “What is the 
                <lb/>matter, <persName>Mary</persName>?” “Matter, nothing, only I don’t like 
                <lb/><persName>George’s</persName> design of bringing that woman here; the world 
                <lb/>has been very loud in their censures of her.” “The world 
                <lb/>often censures the innocent; but even supposing she has 
                <lb/>been imprudent, may she not have seen her errors, and 
                <lb/>may she not, if countenanced by women of character, re-
                <lb break="no"/>turn to rectitude?” “Did you never hear of her before you 
                <lb/>were married?” “No.” “Well, the world said she was 
                <lb/>very liberal of her favors to cousin <persName>George</persName>.” “Again I 
                <lb/>repeat, the world often says more than is true; but were 
                <lb/>that even the case, as she is now situated, she had better be 
                <lb/>under my protection, than thrown entirely on his.” <persName>Mr. 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName> at that moment called me; I went with him, gave 
                <lb/>the requested invitation; it was accepted, and last evening 
                <lb/>she became an inmate of my family. Her person is fine, 
                <lb/>though she is past thirty; her manners graceful, and her 
                <lb/>mind highly accomplished.—I hope and trust the world 
                <lb/>have censured her unjustly.—I shall be anxious to hear from 
                <lb/>you; write soon, for your approbation is, next to that of my 
                <lb/>own heart, of the utmost importance to

                I ENCLOSE you two letters, which I have received 
                <lb/>from <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, and they will sufficiently account for 
                <lb/>my not paying you my intended visit; you will perceive 
                <lb/>when you have perused them, that all is not right in the 
                <lb/>family of our friend. I am angry with <persName>Darnley</persName>; he has 
                <lb/>led his wife into an improper connexion, and I strongly 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>suspect his motives are not such as would bear a strict scru-
                <lb break="no"/>tiny. I am not better pleased with the officious meddling 
                <lb/>of <persName>Miss Melbourn</persName>; she might, and indeed ought to have 
                <lb/>hinted to her cousin, the impropriety of his introducing a 
                <lb/>woman to his wife whose character was suspicious; and 
                <lb/>who had been sent into France by her husband, because he 
                <lb/>had reasons to suppose that too great an intimacy subsisted 
                <lb/>between her and <persName>Darnley</persName>. This, I say, would have been a 
                <lb/>duty; but she ought by no means to have awakened sus-
                <lb break="no"/>picions in <persName>Mrs Darnley’s</persName> bosom derogatory to her hus-
                <lb break="no"/>band’s honor; there might have been methods taken to 
                <lb/>have shamed him out of his folly, (not to give it a harsher 
                <lb/>name,) without interrupting the peace of his wife. I do not 
                <lb/>think <persName>Sarah</persName> is of a jealous temper, but the inuendos of <persName>Ma-
                  <lb break="no"/>ry Melbourn</persName> might awaken suspicion, and where suspi-
                <lb break="no"/>cion is once called into action, every word, look and move-
                <lb break="no"/>ment is considered through a false medium, and even the 
                <lb/>most innocent, construed into proofs of guilt. I am con-
                <lb break="no"/>vinced that, more than half the uneasinesses that subsist be-
                <lb break="no"/>tween married persons have originated in meddling friends 
                <lb/>of either sex; but to our shame I must own, I believe our 
                <lb/>own sex more addicted to this folly than the other: <choice><orig>Let a person</orig><reg>Let 
                <lb/>persons</reg></choice> think what they will, unless they have proofs be-
                <lb break="no"/>yond the <choice><orig>smallest doubt of the truth and their suspicion</orig><reg>possibility of doubt</reg></choice>, 
                <lb/>they ought to be silent; and even in that case, it is better 
                <lb/>to reason with the offending party, than to hint their dis-
                <lb break="no"/>coveries to the husband or wife, whom either ardent affec-
                <lb break="no"/>tion, or perfect indifference, may have rendered blind; for 
                <lb/>though in the latter case, there is no fear of lacerating the 
                <lb/>heart of the person to whom the information is given; yet 
                <lb/>wounded pride will often, nay, perhaps oftener, lead to fa-
                <lb break="no"/>tal consequences than slighted affection.
              </p>
              <p>
                This <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> bears the character of a very artful 
                <lb/>woman. Her husband was a Frenchman, and she herself, 
                <lb/>having been educated in that country, had imbibed much 
                <lb/>of that lightness and flippancy which characterize the wo-
                <lb break="no"/>men of that nation.—her mind is cultivated; but it did not 
                <lb/>in early life receive a proper bias; she had no kind parent 
                <lb/>to restrain the exuberance of her vivacity, to teach her to 
                <lb/>keep her passions under the subjection of reason and reli-
                <lb break="no"/>gion; natural consequence followed, the former hurried 
                <lb/>her into imprudencies, the latter plunged her into guilt. I 
                <lb/>say guilt, because there is no reason to doubt of her crim-
                <lb break="no"/>inal intimacy with <persName>Darnley</persName>.—The summer before he be-
                <lb break="no"/>came acquainted with <persName>Sarah</persName>, this woman had a small house 
                <lb/>near the summer residence of <persName>Darnley’s</persName> family. Her man-
                <lb break="no"/>ners being polished, her temper naturally sweet, her cheer-
                <lb break="no"/>fulness exhilarating to all with whom she associated, she 
                <lb/>soon became a favorite with <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, who, having 
                <lb/>met her several times at visits in the neighborhood, invit-
                <lb break="no"/>ed her to her house, and an intimacy ensued. <persName>Mr. Ro-
                  <lb break="no"/>main</persName> was considerably older than herself, but his affection 
                <lb/>to her was evident in all his actions. The difference in their 
                <lb/>age was not so great as to make their union appear pre-
                <lb break="no"/>posterous; he might have been fifteen years the elder; but 
                <lb/>he was a man whom any woman might respect, and when 
                <lb/>treated by him as his wife ever was, whom it would, one 
                <lb/>would imagine, be next to impossible not to love. He was 
                <lb/>sensible, had the manners of a gentleman; was of an easy 
                <lb/>temper, and unbounded benevolence. <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>, at the 
                <lb/>time she became intimate in <persName>Mr. Darnley’s</persName> family, was 
                <lb/><supplied>the</supplied> mother of a fine boy, and on the eve of again becoming a 
                <lb/>parent; indulged by a fond husband, to whom she owed 
                <lb/>every thing, in every wish of her heart, adored—caressed
                <lb/>—never opposed; is it not wonderful that she could be so 
                <lb/>depraved, as wilfully to throw from her this inexhaustible 
                <lb/>mine of happiness, and court ruin and infamy? I write 
                <lb/>not from hear-say; I write from incontestible proofs<choice><orig>; my</orig><reg>. My</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>mother’s sister lived in the next house, and was un-
                <lb break="no"/>willingly made a party in the scene of confusion which fol-
                <lb break="no"/>lowed the discovery of her lapse from virtue. <persName>Mr. Ro-
                  <lb break="no"/>main</persName> having confided some papers to her care, when first 
                <lb/>he began to fear his wife’s affections were estranged from 
                <lb/>him, without mentioning his suspicions; when those suspi-
                <lb break="no"/>cions were fully confirmed, relieved his almost breaking 
                <lb/>heart, by relating many circumstances, which might other-
                <lb break="no"/>wise have never transpired. My aunt never mentioned 
                <lb/>the affair until after <persName>Darnley</persName> was married to my friend 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName>; and then a sudden exclamation, that he was un-
                <lb break="no"/>worthy so good a wife, led to the relation. I will continue 
                <lb/>my narrative next week. <closer><hi rend="italic">Adieu</hi>,

                THE autumn of the summer mentioned to you in my 
                <lb/>last, business of a very particular nature, took <persName>Mr. Romain</persName> 
                <lb/>to <placeName>Paris</placeName>. His wife having just recovered from her con-
              <lb break="no"/>finement, was not able to undertake the journey with him; 
              <lb/>though her perfect state of convalescence, was evinced very 
              <lb/>shortly after his departure. <persName>George Darnley</persName> had visited 
              <lb/>there frequently, while the husband was at home; his vis-
              <lb break="no"/>its were after he was gone, as frequent as ever; this 
              <lb/>would not have been noticed by the neighbors had it 
              <lb/>rested there, but he took her often out to ride in a chaise, 
              <lb/>perhaps as often as twice a week; sometimes they would 
              <lb/>go out in the morning and remain out all day; sometimes 
              <lb/>he waited on her to the play, to the opera, and once to a 
              <lb/>masquerade, from whence they did not return until day light 
              <lb/>in the morning. In October, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> and her fam-
              <lb break="no"/>ily returned to <placeName>London</placeName>, but <persName>George</persName> found various pretences 
              <lb/>for sleeping in the country, and at length they were so lost 
              <lb/>to all sense of propriety, that he passed every night at her 
              <lb/>house, alleging by way of excuse, that as the nights grew 
              <lb/>long, she was afraid to sleep alone in a house so far from 
              <lb/>town, to which place, her health and that of her infant, 
              <lb/>(who was indeed extremely indisposed) would not permit 
              <lb/>her to return. Thus the autumn, and almost the whole 
              <lb/>winter wore away: in February, <persName>Mr. Romain</persName> came unex-
              <lb break="no"/>pectedly home. It was evening when he arrived, and ex-
              <lb break="no"/>pressed some astonishment at seeing <persName>George Darnley</persName> there, 
              <lb/>quite in a family way, for as it was late, he had his slippers 
              <lb/>on.—But whatever he might think, he said but little. A 
              <lb/>few days after his arrival, he called on my aunt, and put-
              <lb break="no"/>ting a packet of papers into her hands, requested her to 
              <lb/>keep them until he called for them, saying, they were of 
              <lb/>great consequence, and he would not have her part with 
              <lb/>them to any person whatever. My aunt had very little 
              <lb/>commerce with <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>, but now and then, she 
              <lb/>would come of a morning, and sit an hour or two when 
              <lb/>the weather prevented her from making longer excursions, 
              <lb/>or perhaps, when she wished to avoid any company whom 
              <lb/>she had reason to think would call at that time. In one 
              <lb/>of these chance visits, she informed my aunt, that <persName>Mr. Ro-
                <lb break="no"/>main</persName> had thoughts of removing to <placeName>St. Omer’s</placeName>; that he had 
              <lb/>a sister settled there, and wanted his family to be near her. 
              <lb/>“I do not want to go,” continued she, “his sister is a stiff, 
              <lb/>formal old maid, who has lived all her life in a convent, 
              <lb/>though she is not a nun; he only wants to be there, that 
              <lb/>she may be a spy upon my conduct; and when he makes 
              <lb/>a journey, he may clap me into the stupid nunnery; for he 
              <lb/>says no woman ought to remain in society, receiving and 
              <lb/>paying visits, and going to public places, when her hus-
              <lb break="no"/>band is absent.” My aunt could make no reply to such 
              <lb/>a remark, she had thought herself that <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> would 
              <lb/>have shewn most prudence by remaining more at home, 
              <lb/>and not admitting young Darnley to be so constantly with 
              <lb/>her: she had thought her conduct very reprehensible, but 
              <lb/>she was not upon such intimate terms as could authorize 
              <lb/>a remonstrance, which, however, delicately given, or friend-
              <lb break="no"/>ly designed, might have been deemed impertinence. <persName>Mr. 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>Romain</persName> had been home but a short time, when the death 
              <lb/>of their youngest child seemed to recal the mother to some 
              <lb/>degree of reflection, for several weeks, she led a retir-
              <lb break="no"/>ed life, and all company was excluded the house. But the 
              <lb/>heart that has once become the slave of a depraved affec-
              <lb break="no"/>tion, soon grows insensible to those which do honor to 
              <lb/>humanity. And retirement with a husband who almost 
              <lb/>idolized his children, and who most severely felt the death 
              <lb/>of this little girl, by no means suited the levity of her dis-
              <lb break="no"/>position. She had made some acquaintances with women 
              <lb/>of doubtful reputation; her husband remonstrated, but she 
              <lb/>was incorrigible; and persisted even in appearing with 
              <lb/>them in public. This hastened his preparations for a re-
              <lb break="no"/>moval, though in the mean time, he harbored the most 
              <lb/>tormenting suspicions; these suspicions were at length ful-
              <lb break="no"/>ly confirmed. 
              </p>
              <p>
                It was late one evening, my aunt was just preparing to 
                <lb/>retire for the night, when <persName>Mrs. Romain’s</persName> upper servant 
                <lb/>came running into the house, and with a terrified aspect, 
                <lb/>begged her to go to her mistress, whom she believed was 
                <lb/>dying—“There has been dreadful work at our house, 
                <lb/>ma’am,” said the young woman, “but master begs you 
                <lb/>will come in.” My aunt threw on a shawl hastily, and 
                <lb/>followed the maid. She found <persName>Mr. Romain</persName> pale, and 
                <lb/>dreadfully agitated, leaning over a sofa, on which lay his 
                <lb/>imprudent wife, deprived of sense and motion. “Come, 
                <lb/>madam,” said he, in a voice almost choaked with contend-
                <lb break="no"/>ing passions, “come, and do something for this unhappy 
                <lb/>woman, whom fear, shame, and anxiety for an unworthy 
                <lb/>villain, whom I have horsewhipped out of my house, have 
                <lb/>thrown into this situation.” They applied <seg xml:id="a043" corresp="#n043">volatiles</seg><note xml:id="n043" corresp="#a043"><term style="font-style: italic">Volatiles</term>: smelling salts.</note> to her 
                <lb/>nose, temples, and wrists, loosened her clothes, and in about 
                <lb/>half an hour, she began to have some recollection: the 
                <lb/>moment she saw her husband, who had been, spite of his 
                <lb/>injuries, anxiously assiduous about her, while in a state of 
                <lb/>insensibility; she raised her hands, clasped them in an ag-
                <lb break="no"/>ony, covered her face, and burst into tears. “Do not leave 
                <lb/>her, madam, I entreat you,” said the distracted husband, “I 
                <lb/>cannot speak to her now, but will endeavor to regain some 
                <lb/>composure, and return to her in an hour or two.” He left 
                <lb/>them, and shut himself up in his study. <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> was 
                <lb/>led to her bed chamber, she spoke not a word, but her 
                <lb/>tears flowed so violently, that it appeared like hysterical 
                <lb/>affection;they prevailed upon her to take some wine and 
                <lb/>water, into which they put a few drops of a composing na-
                <lb break="no"/>ture, which my aunt had sent for from her own house; this, in 
                <lb/>a measure, stilled the agitation of her frame, and towards 
                <lb/>morning, she dropped into a broken slumber. At daylight, 
                <lb/><persName>Mr. Romain</persName> sent a request to speak to my aunt; she went 
                <lb/>to his study, giving the servant a strict charge not to quit 
                <lb/>her mistress.
              </p>
              <p>
                “You see, Madam,” said he, as my aunt entered, “a 
                <lb/>man almost driven to distraction, by the infidelity of a wo-
                <lb break="no"/>man he adores; when I brought you those papers some 
                <lb/>few weeks since, I had great reason to suppose my wife had 
                <lb/>forfeited her good name, and made a sacrifice of my honor, 
                <lb/>on the altar of illicit passion. I had picked up a paper 
                <lb/>folded in the form of a letter, but without superscription or 
                <lb/>signature, I thought the writing to be that of <persName>Jessey’s</persName>; but 
                <lb/>the hand was so disguised, I could not be certain. This 
                <lb/>infamous scrawl, expressed a thorough dislike to one person 
                <lb/>whom I suspected was myself, and a most passionate regard 
                <lb/>for another, whom I imagined to be that insidious villain, 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName>. It expressed a strong desire to be released from 
                <lb/>the fetters which bound the writer to one, and set her at 
                <lb/>liberty to devote herself to the other; an offer to quit her 
                <lb/>legal protector, and go to any part of the world with her 
                <lb/>paramour; concluding with saying, she could take with 
                <lb/>her papers, which would secure her independence. This 
                <lb/>I imagine, referred to the writings of an estate, which, 
                <lb/>previous to our marriage, I had settled on <persName>Jessey</persName>. I shew-
                <lb break="no"/>ed her this diabolical paper; but she denied all knowledge 
                <lb/>of it, with such asseverations, and resented my suspicions 
                <lb/>with such an appearance of conscious innocence, that I al-
                <lb break="no"/>most doubted the evidence of my own senses, which had 
                <lb/>noticed familiarities between her and Darnley, which were 
                <lb/>very unbecoming a virtuous married woman. Determined 
                <lb/>to put the writings mentioned beyond her reach, I placed 
                <lb/>them with you. The death of our poor little girl, whose 
                <lb/>decease I now rejoice in, as she was snatched from the ob-
                <lb break="no"/>loquy which ever attends the daughter of a vicious mother; 
                <lb/>I say, Madam, the death of her child made some altera-
                <lb break="no"/>tion in her conduct, which was very pleasant to me; and I 
                <lb/>began to hope she would see the folly and guilt of her past

                <persName>Elinor</persName>, I know you are interested in this narrative, 
                <lb/>but I must drop my pen for the present. It is a beautiful

                I PURSUE my subject. Suppose <persName>Mr. Romain</persName> again 
                <lb/>speaking. “Last night madam, I was fatally convinced, 
                <lb/>all my suspicions were just; suffer me to remain silent con-
                <lb break="no"/>cerning the scene to which I was an excruciating witness. 
                <lb/>I rushed into the room, with a horsewhip in my hand, (for 
                <lb/>I had rode from town,) and made the dishonorable reptile 
                <lb/>feel its lash pretty severely. It is my firm resolution never 
                <lb/>to live with my lost <persName>Jessey</persName> again; but I will not expose her 
                <lb/>to the world. I will not drive her from me, and by so 
                <lb/>doing, plunge her into the abyss of shame and infamy; I 
                <lb/>am resolved to protect her against her will. I have fear-
                <lb break="no"/>ed, and I am now convinced, that a living witness of her 
                <lb/>defection will appear. But my friends in <placeName>France</placeName>, will 
                <lb/>know nothing of what has passed, and I will place her in 
                <lb/>the convent at <placeName>St. Omer’s</placeName>, where my sister has been from 
                <lb/>choice many years a boarder; here she may remain until 
                <lb/>the unfortunate little being sees the light. I will then con-
                <lb break="no"/>sider what is best to be done. I shall leave this place, and 
                <lb/>if possible, <placeName>England</placeName>, this very day; and must request you 
                <lb/>to see to the packing of the plate, linen, &amp;c. in order to 
                <lb/>their being sent after us. I shall empower a person to sell 
                <lb/>the furniture, and remit me the proceeds. I think it will 
                <lb/>be best not to take any of our present domestics, as they are 
                <lb/>but too well acquainted with <persName>Jessey’s</persName> frailty; I have sent to 
                <lb/>the inn for a post chaise, and must beg you to go and pre-
                <lb break="no"/>pare the unhappy woman for her removal.”
              </p>
              <p>
                My aunt returned to <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>; she found her awake 
                <lb/>and rising. It was an awkward task to inform her of her 
                <lb/>husband’s resolution. She stood with her face from my 
                <lb/>aunt while she was speaking; but when she found she was 
                <lb/>silent, she turned and thus addressed: “I am obliged to 
                <lb/>you, Madam, for the trouble you have taken; I understand 
                <lb/>you have been in the house all night; and I have no doubt 
                <lb/>but it is to your advice I owe this hasty determination of 
                <lb/><persName>Mr. Romain</persName>. I must confess I think you have been unne-
                <lb break="no"/>cessarily officious, and must beg the few moments I have to 
                <lb/>tarry in my house, I may remain unmolested.” As 
                <lb/>she was speaking, the chaise drove up to the door, and <persName>Mr. 
                  <lb/>Romain</persName> entered the room. “Come, Madam,” said he to 
                <lb/>his wife in a solemn voice, “give orders to your servant to 
                <lb/>pack up a change of clothes, and do you prepare yourself 
                <lb/>for a journey; breakfast is ready in the parlor; take from 
                <lb/>your drawers what you want, and then deliver your keys 
                <lb/>to this lady, who will take care that every thing is sent af-
                <lb break="no"/>ter you.” “Sir,” said she in a haughty tone, “I do not choose 
                <lb/>that any stranger should have the liberty of examining my 
                <lb/>drawers.” “If, Madam,” he replied, in a firm and pointed 
                <lb/>manner, “you have any thing is them you are afraid or 
                <lb/>ashamed of having seen, it were best you removed or destroy-
                <lb break="no"/>ed it before you went away; but I desire you to be quick, as 
                <lb/>I must depart within the hour.” She colored; a few tears 
                <lb/>forced themselves down her cheeks; while in an unsteady 
                <lb/>voice, she begged to be left alone ten minutes; her request 
                <lb/>was complied with; she then came down stairs, with a 
                <lb/>forced appearance of composure, habited ready for her jour-
                <lb break="no"/>ney. She drank a cup of chocolate with difficulty; and, 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>when her husband enquired if she was ready to go, arose 
                <lb/>from her seat, saying, “no—neither ready nor willing; 
                <lb/>but it is your pleasure, and I must obey.” She trembled 
                <lb/>so, she could scarcely stand; the color left her cheeks, and 
                <lb/>it was with unequal steps, and a bosom that throbbed al-
                <lb break="no"/>most to suffocation, that she seated herself in the chaise. <persName>Mr. 
                  <lb/>Romain</persName> drew up the glasses; and a few hours took her 
                <lb/>out of <persName>England</persName>; to which, had she been prudent had nev-
                <lb break="no"/>er returned. These circumstances, being made known to 
                <lb/>me, when it was too late to prevent <persName>Sarah</persName> from forming 
                <lb/>a connexion which, I greatly fear, will prove the ruin of 
                <lb/>her peace, I thought best not to mention them; nor have 
                <lb/>I, since my return, permitted her to think I am in the least 
                <lb/>acquainted with any circumstance concerning <persName>Mrs. Ro-
                  <lb break="no"/>main</persName>. But I am determined to keep a strict eye upon her, 
                <lb/>and if I see her laying any plans to regain her ascendancy 
                <lb/>over <persName>Darnley</persName>, I shall speak my mind both to him and her, 
                <lb/>in a manner that will not be very pleasing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, at present, seems inclined to think all the 
                <lb/>reports which she has heard, were groundless.—<persName>Jessey</persName>, (as I 
                <lb/>shall henceforth call her,) is a specious woman; very insin-
                <lb break="no"/>uating in her manner; and my dear <persName>Sarah</persName>, with all her good 
                <lb/>sense, is very credulous, and open to deception; but I 
                <lb/>do earnestly hope that the film will not fall from her eyes 
                <lb/>in this respect; for what situation in life is more mortify-
                <lb break="no"/>ing, than that of a neglected wife? A knowledge of treach-
                <lb break="no"/>ery on the part of her husband, would awaken all her re-
                <lb break="no"/>sentment. I know her, she would never reproach him; 
                <lb/>she would never consider his breach of duty as an apology 
                <lb/>for any failure of her own. She would continue immove-
                <lb break="no"/>able in the path of rectitude; but such an exertion would 
                <lb/>cause her many bitter tears; and her sufferings would be 
                <lb/>more poignant, because she would conceal them in her own 
                <lb/>bosom, and wear the mask of serenity over a lacerated 
                <lb/>heart. I shall let you know what discoveries I make; I 
                <lb/>shall not be inquisitively prying, but I shall observe and 
                <lb/>draw conclusions from those observations, not to gratify any 
                <lb/>impertinent curiosity, but in order to guard the peace of 
                <lb/>the invaluable <persName>Sarah</persName>.

                <placeName>London</placeName>, at this period, is not very pleasant; <persName>Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>talks of taking a lodging at <placeName>Islington</placeName>; I think I see through 
                <lb/>his plans; his wife acquiesces in all that he proposes; she 
                <lb/>is pleased with the idea of being in the country—I hope it 
                <lb/>will, in the end, contribute to her felicity; but I greatly 
                <lb/>fear it will not. One remark I have made since my return 
                <lb/>is, that <persName>Darnley</persName> lives very freely, and has a number of men 
                <lb/>always after him, who look like professed gamblers; they 
                <lb/>are ill bred, and by no means society fit for his delicate, 
                <lb/>gentle wife. <hi rend="italic"><closer>Adieu, I am in truth, Yours,

                THIS <persName>Jessey</persName> is more artful than I believed her to be; she 
                <lb/>has gained such an ascendancy over <persName>Sarah</persName>, that she leads 
                <lb/>her into all manner of dissipation and extravagance. She 
                <lb/>is ever on the wing, always in a crowd; a good way, you 
                <lb/>will say, of making her inattentive to her own particular 
                <lb/>conduct. The autumnal amusements have commenced, 
                <lb/>and the play, the opera, or some fashionable party occupies 
                <lb/>every evening; this leads to great expenses, constantly ap-
                <lb break="no"/>pearing in public, requiring numerous changes of dress. 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName>, indulged from infancy in elegant <seg xml:id="a046" corresp="#n046">habiliments,</seg><note xml:id="n046" corresp="#a046"><term style="font-style: italic">Habiliments</term>: clothing.</note> though 
                <lb/>her own taste prevents her dressing fine, is thoughtlessly 
                <lb/>extravagant; elegant laces, rich satins, with gloves, caps, 
                <lb/>shoes, &amp;c. suitable, are not procured for a trifling sum in the 
                <lb/>course of a year; and <persName>Sarah</persName> is, perhaps, not so careful of her 
                <lb/><choice><orig>cloaths</orig><reg>clothes</reg></choice>, or attentive to the expenditures of her house-keep-
                <lb break="no"/>ing as she ought to be; her heart is naturally liberal; she 
                <lb/>has no idea of being imposed on by her servants, and when 
                <lb/>sometimes a slight suspicion will cross her mind, that her 
                <lb/>provisions are wasted, or her clothes wilfully lost, any plau-
                <lb break="no"/>sible excuse will quiet her, and from a native love of peace, 
                <lb/>she will cease to enquire concerning her domestic concerns, 
                <lb/>or appear satisfied, when in fact, she is not convinced; she 
                <lb/>exerts but little authority in the management of her fam-
                <lb break="no"/>ily: dressing, making and receiving visits, late hours at 
                <lb/>night, and, consequently, late mornings, have in appearance, 
                <lb/>totally altered the character of the late interesting <persName>Sarah</persName>. 
                <lb/>She gives dinners and suppers, in very high style, and is 
                <lb/>herself the very soul of the parties she draws around her; 
                <lb/>while <persName>Jessey</persName>, satisfied with having persuaded or flattered her 
                <lb/>into these follies, with an assumed humility, declines join-
                <lb break="no"/>ing the parties, and I am well convinced, has more than 
                <lb/>once instigated Darnley to blame <persName>Sarah</persName> for a conduct, 
                <lb/>which I acknowledge very reprehensible, but she should 
                <lb/>be remonstrated with mildly, and not vulgarly reproached, 
                <lb/>and taunted with having all the extravagant propensities of 
                <lb/>a fine lady, without having brought any fortune to support 
                <lb/>them. Yet this unmanly reproach was made to the humiliat-
                <lb break="no"/>ed <persName>Sarah</persName>, in my presence, a few days since. To which she 
                <lb/>replied, with more sincerity than prudence: “You knew 
                <lb/>my poverty, and wilfully burthened yourself with a woman, 
                <lb/>who can neither feel nor think as you do. Yet, <persName>Mr. Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName>, let me add, if you had treated me with the confidence due 
                  <lb/>to a wife, you would have always found me conformable in 
                  <lb/>my dress and pursuits, to the circumstances of a husband, 
                  <lb/>whom it is my duty, and would be my pride, to honor if 
                  <lb/>he would let me.”—This occasioned a violent altercation; 
                  <lb/>he told her, it was not because he could not afford it, but be-
                  <lb break="no"/>cause he did not <emph>choose</emph>, that she should lead so gay a life, 
                <lb/>that he found fault;. she flew out of the room, and gave 
                <lb/>vent to her full heart by tears, (which she ever <choice><orig>endeavours</orig><reg>endeavors</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>to restrain in his presence) in her own apartment<choice><orig>; thither</orig><reg>. Thither</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>the officious, intrusive <persName>Jessey</persName> followed her, and I was aston-
                <lb break="no"/>ished when we met at dinner, for I was passing the day with 
                <lb/>her, to find her dressed, and hear her declare, she meant to 
                <lb/>join a party to the play, from whence she was going 
                <lb/>to a card party, and that she meant to sup out. She en-
                <lb break="no"/>treated me to accompany her; but I very good naturedly 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>felt at that moment a strong propensity to stay and keep 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> company. And stay I did, much to the mor-
                <lb break="no"/>tification of that <emph>amiable</emph> lady, and her more <emph>amiable chere 
                  <lb/>amie</emph>. I found a new novel in Sarah’s dressing room, and 
                <lb/>bidding the maid fetch <persName>Mrs. Romain’s</persName> work, told <persName>Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>we did not want him, and that he  might as well follow his 
                <lb/>wife to the play; and having partly laughed, and partly <choice><orig>satyrized</orig><reg>sa-
                  <lb break="no"/>tirized</reg></choice> him into some sense of shame; I had the pleasure to 
                <lb/>see him depart, and very composedly begun and finished 
                <lb/>the novel before twelve o’clock; at which hour, <persName>Jessey</persName> be-
                <lb break="no"/>ing no longer able to command her impatience, and pre-
                <lb break="no"/>tend pleasure, when in truth she was bursting with vexa-
                <lb break="no"/>tion, said she was sleepy, rang for candles, and with a pro-
                <lb break="no"/>fusion of civility, bade me a good night.
              </p>
              <p>
                About two o’clock <persName>Sarah</persName> returned, and <persName>Darnley</persName> with her; 
                <lb/>he was very petulant, and taking a candle, went imme-
                <lb break="no"/>diately to his room. <persName>Sarah</persName> threw herself on the sofa, and 
                <lb/>burst into tears. “What is the matter, my dear?” —I asked. 
                <lb/>“Nothing of consequence,” said she, “I am ashamed of my-
                <lb break="no"/>self, but, “I am afraid my dear <persName>Sarah</persName>,” said I, in a soft-
                <lb break="no"/>ened, almost hesitating voice, “that you are somewhat to 
                <lb/>blame, in the little disagreement of to-day; you must not 
                <lb/>be offended, you have even given me leave to be sincere 
                <lb/>with you—why, when <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> expressed a dislike to 
                <lb/>your leading so dissipated a life, why did you immediately 
                <lb/>dress and go out; my dear friend, you must submit a little.” 
                <lb/>“<persName>Anne</persName>,” said she, wiping away her tears, “I feel you are 
                <lb/>right, but I cannot command my temper at all times. I 
                <lb/>know it is wrong to complain, the die is cast, and I must 
                <lb/>be silent and unresisting.—but, my dear <persName>Anne</persName>, why does he 
                <lb/>not treat me with confidence? why am I kept a stranger 
                <lb/><choice><orig>to</orig><reg>in</reg></choice> all his concerns? I know not whether he can afford 
                <lb/>the style in which we live, or whether he is worth a single

                <lb/>it is the last time, <persName>Ann</persName>, I will ever speak on the subject; 
                <lb/>but my lot is not a very happy one, even at the best; and,

                <lb/>from whom her nature shrinks repugnant; whose every 
                <lb/>word, opinion and action, is an outrage to her sensibility, I 
                <lb/>would have gone out  to the most menial day labor, before 
                <lb/>I would have taken upon myself duties I have not the pa-
                <lb break="no"/>tience and fortitude to fulfil as I ought. Heaven knows,” 
                <lb/>continued she, and her lips began to work, and her voice to 
                <lb/><choice><orig>falter</orig><reg>faulter</reg></choice>, “Heaven knows I strive to consider him with 
                <lb/>respect; to behold him with affection; but how can I

                <lb/>rudeness and contempt, and the next, with a disgust-
                <lb break="no"/>ing fondness, even more repulsive to my nature, than his
                <lb/><choice><orig>nature?</orig><reg>?</reg></choice> <persName>Anne</persName>, I have spoken with sincerity; I ever con-

                <lb/>bury what I have said in your bosom. When you see me 
                <lb/>act wrong, as I know I have done to-day, do not hesitate to re-
                <lb break="no"/>prove me; but in regard to him, I pray you be silent; he 
                <lb/>is apparently good natured, liberal and cheerful; the world 
                <lb/>believes me happy, I would not undeceive them.” “I 
                <lb/>will implicitly regard your prudent injunction,” I replied, 
                <lb/>struck with the magnanimity of her resolution, “but will 
                <lb/>you allow me to mention one thing more, which I really 
                <lb/>think it my duty to point out to you, as I believe much of 
                <lb/>your happiness in future will depend on your attending to 
                <lb/>my advice on this subject. Be upon your guard against 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>; do not let her persuade you to act in oppo-
                <lb break="no"/>sition to your husband’s will; and gloss such a conduct 
                <lb/>over with the name of spirit, resolution, and proper inde-
                <lb break="no"/>pendence.” “<persName><choice><orig>Ann</orig><reg>Anne</reg></choice></persName>,” said she, “do you apprehend that

                <lb/>us, do you think?”—I perceived her drift, and, rising, said, 
                <lb/>“I think nothing, only that <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> is not a woman 
                <lb/>whom I could wish to see the friend of <persName>Sarah Darnley</persName>. She

                <lb break="no"/>fied with the appellation of a masculine mind; but she has not 
                <lb/>one quality which should give her an ascendancy over such 
                <lb/>a mind as yours. Good night,” said I, kissing her cheek, “let 
                <lb/>me see you good friends with that unaccountable being your 
                <lb/>husband, to-morrow; and while you have yourself every

                The next morning I had the pleasure to see them quite 
                <lb/>composed and civil to each other; and to prevent any inter-

                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Romain’s</persName> going to spend a few days with me. She

                IT is sometime since I wrote to you; my time has been 
                <lb/>variously occupied, and that not in the most agreeable manner. 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> has suffered much during the period in which my 
                <lb/>pen has lain dormant, and I have given myself up to her comfort. 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName> has lost his mother; she was an amiable woman, 
                  <lb/>and in her society <persName>Sarah</persName> often found solace for her afflicted 
                <lb/>heart. I look upon this bereavement as peculiarly unfor-
                <lb break="no"/>tunate for her, as the respectability of his mother’s charac-
                <lb break="no"/>ter, her steady, though unassuming love of virtue, made 
                <lb/><persName>George</persName> anxious to preserve some respect to decency; 
                <lb/>but that slight restraint removed, he will no longer regard 
                <lb/>appearances. He is going, I fear, the high road to ruin.—
                <lb/>the sums he lavishes on <persName>Jessey</persName>, are astonishing, while a 
                <lb/>tradesman is allowed to call repeatedly for his money to no 
                <lb/>purpose. <persName>Sarah’s</persName> thoughtlessness and folly (for I must 
                <lb/>give it that harsh term) encreases; the more agonized her 
                <lb/>heart, (and agonized it is I am certain in a very high de-
                <lb break="no"/>gree,) the more dissipated her conduct; and to see her in 
                <lb/>company, you would suppose her the happiest of the hap-
                <lb break="no"/>py. When alone, she either sits pensive and unemployed, 
                <lb/>except in reading some work of fancy, or applies to her 
                <lb/>music, playing and singing the most plaintive airs, while 
                <lb/>tears roll down her cheeks, and she seems lost to all but ex-
                <lb break="no"/>quisite sensibility. Yet from such a state of depression, she 
                <lb/>will start suddenly up, dress, and fly to some scene of pleas-
                <lb break="no"/>ure; often losing very considerable sums at cards—and 
                <lb/>seldom or ever returning until very late at night;—some-
                <lb break="no"/>times she is favored with her husband’s company, but of-
                <lb break="no"/>tener she is left to herself. I am almost continually with 
                <lb/>her; for I do not think a young and prepossessing woman 
                <lb/>can be placed in a more perilous situation, than to be neg-
                <lb break="no"/>lected by her husband, and yet constantly mixing in that 
                <lb/>kind of society which abounds with libertines and flatter-
                <lb break="no"/>ers, who think such a woman ever an object of illicit pur-
                <lb break="no"/>suit—-not that I doubt Sarah’s principles, I know she loves 
                <lb/>virtue for its own sake; but she is imprudent, and might 
                <lb/>inadvertently fall into situations, which may ruin her rep-
                <lb break="no"/>utation, and perhaps her peace of mind forever. I am go-
                <lb break="no"/>ing this evening to her house, to remain a week with her, 
                <lb/>and shall not finish my letter until I retire for the night.
              </p>
              <p>
                The veil is at length rent, <persName>Sarah</persName> can no longer even pre-
                <lb break="no"/>tend blindness to the insult her husband has offered 
                <lb/>her; how she will conduct on this trying occasion, I cannot 
                <lb/>think, nor can I dare to advise, I can only commiserate her 
                <lb/>situation, and weep, not with, (for she has not shed a tear,) 
                <lb/>but for her. My mind is so agitated, and has been since 
                <lb/>the discovery has been made, that I could not write last 
                <lb/>night, and even now, I hardly know how to frame my ac-
                <lb break="no"/>count, for the scene of last evening seems in my memory 
                <lb/>but as the traces of a horrid vision. But I will endeavor 
                <lb/>to proceed with some degree of regularity. I have already 
                <lb/>told you, I was to go to <persName>Mrs. Darnley’s</persName> last evening with a 
                <lb/>design to spend a week. I had appointed to meet her in 
                <lb/>a large party, at a friend’s house in <placeName>Berkley-street</placeName>, and was 
                <lb/>to proceed home with her after the party broke up. She 
                <lb/>was not there when I arrived, but came soon after accom-
                <lb break="no"/>panied by <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>. “Where is <persName>Darnley</persName>?” said I, 
                <lb/>when she was seated beside me. “he had the head ache,” 
                <lb/>she replied, “and will not come out to night.” “Then 
                <lb/>why, my dear <persName>Sarah</persName>,” said I, “did you come out?” “why, 
                <lb/><persName>Anne</persName>,” she replied, rather petulantly, “you know my com-
                <lb break="no"/>pany affords him no pleasure; his conversation is only fit 
                <lb/>for the gaming table, the race ground, or a worse place. I 
                <lb/>cannot, will not listen to discourse so offensive to my ears, 
                <lb/>so degrading to my feelings; and he will listen to no oth-
                <lb break="no"/>er.” I knew well enough this was the case, and therefore 
                <lb/>could say no more. She seemed a moment after to recol-
                <lb break="no"/>lect herself, and said, “I do not mean to stay late;” how-
                <cb/>
                <lb break="no"/>ever she got  down to a commerce table, and forgot her 
                <lb/>good intentions until near one o clock; I then seeing the 
                <lb/>pool was out, and that she was preparing to join another 
                <lb/>party, reminded her of the hour. <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> had been 
                <lb/>engaged in a whist party in another room; we now inquir-
                <lb break="no"/>ed for her, and found she had been sent for above two 
                <lb/>hours before, a message coming that her child was ill. I 
                <lb/>must own my heart sunk at this discovery, and I thought 
                <lb/>a flash of awakened suspicion kindled upon the check of 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName>. It was full half an hour before the coach could get 
                <lb/>up to the door, and even when it did, and we were seated 
                <lb/>in it, whatever were the thoughts of either, we seemed mu-
                <lb break="no"/>tually resolved to restrain them within the bounds of si-
                <lb break="no"/>lence; when we arrived at home, just as the carriage drove 
                <lb/>up to the door, it was opened by one of the maids who was 
                <lb/>letting a visitor out; this prevented the usual rap at the 
                <lb/>door. “Where is <persName>Mrs Romain</persName>?” said <persName>Sarah</persName>, impatiently. 
                <lb/>“in the drawing room,” said the maid. “How is your 
                <lb/>master?” “Better, I believe, he has been in bed these two 
                <lb/>hours.” <persName>Sarah</persName> opened the drawing room door, the can-
                <lb break="no"/>dles were burning on the table, but the room was empty. 
                <lb/>“I will go up and see how <persName>Darnley</persName> is,” said she, taking a 
                <lb/>chamber candle from the servant, “and will see you again 
                <lb/>for a few minutes before I go to bed.” She ran hastily up 
                <lb/>stairs, she is very light of foot, besides which, the stairs are 
                <lb/>carpeted, so that her ascent seemed no more than the glid-
                <lb break="no"/>ing of a shadow. I sat down by the fire; in less than two 
                <lb/>minutes she returned, her face pale, and positively gasping 
                <lb/>for breath.—her limbs scarcely supported her to the sofa 
                <lb/>on which I was sitting, on which she sunk almost insensi-
                <lb break="no"/>ble; alarmed, I rang for water; she swallowed a little, and 
                <lb/>then speaking with difficulty, bade the servant go to bed; 
                <lb/>she could undress herself, she said, and as she knew where 
                <lb/>to find her night clothes, there was no occasion for her to 
                <lb/>go into the room. The poor girl who suspected what was 
                <lb/>the matter, began to speak, but <persName>Sarah</persName> waved her from the 
                <lb/>room with an emphatic “go,” and a motion of the hand, 
                <lb/>which in her carries with it positive command. When the 
                <lb/>maid was gone, she turned to me, and laying her hand on 
                <lb/>my arm, said, “<persName>Jessey</persName> is a serpent—<persName>Darnley</persName> is a wretch.” 
                <lb/>What could I say, I pressed her cold trembling hand, and 
                <lb/>remained silent.—“I will not expose the unprincipled wo-
                <lb break="no"/>man, nor humiliate myself by reproaching the man who 
                <lb/>can thus convince me on what a degrading passion his 
                <lb/>boasted attachment to me was founded. I hardly know 
                <lb/>on what to determine, but this I believe to be my duty, not 
                <lb/>to permit <persName>Jessey</persName> to remain another day under my roof, I 
                <lb/>will go into your room,” said she, rising mournfully, “and 
                <lb/>undress; perhaps I may lie down a few moments beside 
                <lb/>you.” This she did, but neither of us slept, I believe, for 
                <lb/>one moment. About eight o’clock we heard <persName>Darnley’s</persName> 
                <lb/>bell ring violently, she immediately left my chamber with-
                <lb break="no"/>out speaking.—It is almost incredible, yet a cer-
                <lb break="no"/>tain fact, the treacherous husband had the inhumanity to 
                <lb/>endeavor to veil his own conduct by arraigning that of 
                <lb/>his innocent wife. “Where the devil have you been all 
                <lb/>night, madam?” said he, in a loud, imperious tone. “In 
                <lb/><persName>Anne’s</persName> chamber.” “And what is the reason you did not 
                <lb/>come to your own?” “Because,” she replied, in a steady, 
                <lb/>firm voice, “my place was pre-occupied.” “It is a lie,” 
                <lb/>said he, vociferously, “but I see your aim; you are jeal-
                <lb break="no"/>ous, you are envious; but by heaven, if you dare to breathe 
                <lb/>a word.”—“<persName>Mr Darnley</persName>,” said she, “I never loved you 
                <lb/>well enough to be jealous of you. I told you before our 
                <lb/>ill fated union took place, that our hearts could never beat 
                <lb/>in unison. I am now more than ever convinced of it.” 
                <lb/>“But pray, madam,” said he, “what put it into your head 
                <lb/>that your place was occupied; which of the cursed med-
                <lb break="no"/>dling servants?” “Neither of them,” said she, “my own eyes con-
                <lb break="no"/>vinced me; I came up the moment I returned, and the 
                <lb/>first thing I saw was <persName>Jessey’s</persName> shoes,—” “By the bed side,” 
                <lb/>said he, interrupting her, “and so that is all the reason 
                <lb/>you have for thinking <persName>Jessey</persName> was in your place; but, mad-
                <lb break="no"/>am, <persName>Jessey</persName> has twice the tenderness in her nature that you 
                <lb/>have. When she came home, she found me very ill, advis-
                <lb break="no"/>ed me to go to bed, made me some whey, brought it up 
                <lb/>herself, and fearing her shoes might make a noise, put them 
                <lb/>off her feet; sat down, and bathed my temples in hot vin-
                <lb break="no"/>egar: but you, madam, are a wife, you could go gallanting 
                <lb/>about, while your husband was sick at home; but I suppose 
                <lb/>you found more agreeable company and employment a-
                <lb break="no"/>broad, than nursing your husband.” “If I loved you, <persName>Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName>,” said she, “what a miserable being I should now be; 
                <lb/>but thank heaven, that is an agony from which I am spar-
                <lb break="no"/>ed.” She then left him, returned to me, ordered break-
                <lb break="no"/>fast in my room, and when she heard him go out, went to 
                <lb/>her own, in hopes of obtaining a few moments’ repose. I 
                <lb/>have taken the opportunity to write thus far, but as I now 
                <lb/>hear her voice, I must conclude. You shall hear from me 
                <lb/>again soon.</p>

                <persName>DARNLEY’s</persName> dinner hour is four o’clock, the usual time 
                <lb/>for dining with all mercantile persons. Sarah kept her 
                <lb/>room until near three. <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> had never ventured 
                <lb/>down. <persName>Darnley</persName> had been out all the morning. I really 
                <lb/>so much dreaded the general meeting at dinner, that I was 
                <lb/>almost ill; one moment my blood ran cold; another, my 
                <lb/>face flushed like fire: the least stir below, made my heart 
                <lb/>beat quick and my whole frame tremble. About a quarter 
                <lb/>before three, <persName>Sarah</persName> came into my room; she was dressed as 
                <lb/>usual for dinner; and from her countenance, no indifferent 
                <lb/>person could have judged she had been discomposed: it 
                <lb/>was marked with a peculiar kind of sadness, which render-
                <lb break="no"/>ed it interesting; but to me, who knew her, the effort she 
                <lb/>made to conceal her emotions, was very evident. “<persName>Ann</persName>,” 
                <lb/>said she, “I am determined to see and speak to <persName>Jessey</persName>, before 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley’s</persName> return.—how will it be best? to go up into 
                <lb/>her room, or send for her into my dressing room?” I gave 
                <lb/>my opinion for the latter She thought a verbal message 
                <lb/>might have a rude appearance, but wrote on a slip of paper; 
                <cb/>
                <lb/><persName>“Mrs. Darnley</persName> requests <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> to favor her with 
                <lb/>a few minutes conversation previous to their meeting at 
                <lb/>dinner.” The maid went with it, and, after remaining up 
                <lb/>stairs about ten minutes, returned with the following an-
                <lb break="no"/>swer: “After the suspicions of the night, and the pointed 
                <lb/>neglect of the morning, <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> cannot suppose a per-
                <lb break="no"/>sonal interview can be desirable to either party; she begs 
                <lb/>to be excused seeing <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, and also declines ap-
                <lb break="no"/>pearing at dinner; <persname><choice><abbr>Mrs. R.</abbr><expan>Mrs. Romain</expan></choice></persname> will not intrude in <persName><choice><abbr>Mrs. D’s</abbr><expan>Mrs. Darnley's</expan></choice></persName> 
                <lb/>family, longer than she can procure a lodging.”
              </p>
              <p>
                <persName>Sarah’s</persName> countenance changed as she perused this haugh-
                <lb break="no"/>ty scrawl, for the uneven letters betrayed the tremor of the 
                <lb/>hand that wrote them; she tore off the back of the billet, 
                <lb/>and wrote with her pencil:

                  <p>
                  “Madam, a personal interview is not sought from any 
                  <lb/>expected pleasure it may afford, but because I think it ne-
                  <lb break="no"/>cessary to speak a few words to you. I must insist on see-
                  <lb break="no"/>ing you; if you cannot come down, I will come to you.

            <p>
              The servant brought a verbal message, saying, “as <persName>Mrs. 
                <lb/>Darnley</persName> was in her own house, she had a right to go into 
              <lb/>every apartment, if she pleased; therefore, if she insisted upon 
              <lb/>coming up, she (<persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>) must submit.”
            </p>
              <p>
                <persName>Sarah</persName> walked once or twice across the room. “<persName>Ann</persName>,” said 
                <lb/>she, “you must go with me; I hope I shall not forget my-
                <lb break="no"/>self; I hope I shall remember I am a rational being, and a 
                <lb/>christian, and that though this unhappy woman has injur-
                <lb break="no"/>ed me, I am not myself free from error, and have therefore 
                <lb/>no right to treat her with unmerciful contempt.”
              </p>
              <p>
                I do assure you, Madam, when the magnanimous woman 
                <lb/>uttered this sentence, I could not help gazing at her, as a 
                <lb/>being of a superior order. “Heaven support your good 
                <lb/>resolves, my dear <persName>Sarah</persName>,” said I, and was obliged to turn 
                <lb/>from her, to hide my own rising emotion. “Do not be a 
                <lb/>child, <persName><choice><orig>Ann</orig><reg>Anne</reg></choice></persName>,” said she, taking my hand, “or you will make 
                <lb/>a fool of me, and I am weak enough already, heaven knows.”
              </p>
              <p>
                I followed her up stairs without answering, she tapped at 
                <lb/><persName>Jessey’s</persName> door, the little girl opened it, and being extremely 
                <lb/>fond of <persName>Sarah</persName>, gave an instant exclamation of joy, saying, 
                <lb/>“come in, <persName>Ma Darny</persName>; <persName>Lyza</persName> glad, <persName>Lyza</persName> want kiss <persName>ma 
                  <lb/>Darny</persName>.” I feared this innocent prattle would be too much 
                <lb/>for my friend, but I had judged erroneously; she stooped, 
                <lb/>kissed the child, and ringing the bell, bade the maid take her 
                <lb/>down and give her an orange.
              </p>
              <p>
                <persName>Jessey</persName> had risen from her seat; I saw, from her flashing 
                <lb/>eye and crimson cheek, that she expected reproaches; but 
                <lb/>this mild, dignified manner humbled her to the dust; she 
                <lb/>turned pale, and her eyes were absolutely full. <persName>Sarah</persName> seat-
                <lb break="no"/>ed herself, we followed her example; a pause of about a 
                <lb/>minute ensued, in which period I am not certain but I felt 
                <lb/>more than either the injurer or the injured. I perceived 
                <lb/>that <persName>Sarah’s</persName> heart beat high, she struggled for composure; 
                <lb/>she attained it.
              </p>
              <p>
                “I come not, <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>,” said she, in 
                <lb/>a low, but impressive voice, “to recapitulate past events, 
                <lb/>or to awaken resentful emotions by reproaches. Whatev-
                <lb break="no"/>er were the circumstances which took place last evening, 
                <lb/>I wish them to be buried in eternal oblivion. I am, from 
                <lb/>a sense of what is due to myself, under the necessity of in-

                <lb/>but I must request you will procure a lodging as early as 
                <lb/>you can. It is for the respectability of all parties, that the 
                <lb/>subject be not spoken of, and particularly for your interest. 
                <lb/>You may rest assured from me, it shall never transpire, and 
                <lb/>I can answer for this young lady, that through her it will 
                <lb/>never be made public; but, should such circumstances take 
                <lb/>place again, I cannot answer for the discretion of others;

                <lb break="no"/>tion will be entirely lost; nor will any woman of charac-
                <lb break="no"/>ter countenance you.”—“I am sorry,” said she , in a tremu-
                <lb break="no"/>lous voice, “that any misunderstanding should have wound-
                <lb break="no"/>ed your peace of mind.”— “Do not labor under a mis-
                <lb break="no"/>take, <choice><orig>Madam</orig><reg>madam</reg></choice>,” said <persName>Sarah</persName>, “you have not wounded my 
                <lb/>peace, though I greatly fear you have forever banished your 
                <lb/>own; but let us talk no more. I must request you to appear at 
                <lb/>dinner, and let our separation, when it takes place, preserve 
                <lb/>the appearance of good breeding.”— So saying, she left the 
                <lb/>room, and went to her own, where she remained until din-
                <lb break="no"/>ner was served. <persName>Darnley</persName> sent word he should dine out; 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> came down, but we eat little, and spoke less. 
                <lb/>In the evening, <persName>Jessey</persName> sent for a coach, and having thanked 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName> for all favors, and received her wishes for her health, 
                <lb/>went to a lodging. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The next morning her trunks were sent after her; but 
                <lb/>the occurrences of that day must be the subject of another 
                <lb/>letter.

                THE morning following, the eventful day of which I 
                <lb/>gave you an account in my last, <persName>Sarah</persName> appeared at the break-
                <lb break="no"/>fast table with a pale languid countenance; she had retir-
                <lb break="no"/>ed early the night before, and I was in hopes, would have 
                <lb/>obtained some quiet repose—a refreshment which her agi-
                <lb break="no"/>tated frame, and tortured mind, seemed greatly to stand in 
                <lb/>need of. I learnt that <persName>Darnley</persName> had not been home all night; 
                <lb/>he had come home early in the morning, and changed his 
                <lb/>clothes, but told the maid he did not wish to have her mis-
                <lb break="no"/>tress disturbed.
              </p>
              <p>
                “I am afraid,” said she, “he fears reproaches, and so a-
                <lb break="no"/>voids his home; but he need not; if he is content to be si-
                <lb break="no"/>lent, I am sure I shall not broach the detestable subject; he 
                <lb/>is now in the <seg xml:id="a053" corresp="#n053">compting house,</seg><note xml:id="n053" corresp="#a053"><term style="font-style: italic">Compting house</term>: a counting house, or accounting office; also a place to store or borrow money.</note> has sent me word he is ve-
                <lb break="no"/>ry busy, and will have his breakfast sent thither. What 
                <lb/>can I do? Some method must be taken to make him ban-
                <lb break="no"/>ish this fear of again meeting me. I had thought of writ-
                <lb break="no"/>ing a note, dictated in terms which may tend to a recon-
                <lb break="no"/>ciliation; for while he retains these fears of reproaches 
                <lb/>which conscience tells him he deserves, he will hide them 
                <lb/>under ill nature; and suspecting I shall accost him in taunt-
                <lb break="no"/>ing language, will, to prevent it, load me with the most il-
                <lb break="no"/>liberal abuse.”
              </p>
              <p>
                I approved the idea, and she wrote while eating her 
                <lb/>breakfast, the following.

                    “It is certainly painful to me, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>, to find you 
                    <lb/>voluntarily avoid my society. Perhaps I can divine the 
                    <lb/>cause, and by removing it, the effect may happily cease. 
                    <lb/>You think my sex and situation will lead me, when we 
                    <lb/>meet, to recapitulate some late events, and make disagreea-
                    <lb break="no"/>ble remarks thereon. Such a recapitulation is by no means 
                    <lb/>necessary. Let us meet as though no such events had ev-
                    <lb break="no"/>er taken place: let the whole pass into eternal oblivion: 
                    <lb/>trust me, it shall not be my fault if it does not. I hope 
                    <lb/>you will dine at home to day; <persName>Ann</persName> is engaged, and if you 
                    <lb/>should dine out also, I shall dine alone.

                  This letter was evidently what it appeared to be, the ef-
                  <lb break="no"/>fect of principle; she would perhaps rather have dined 
                  <lb/>alone, than with her husband in his present frame of mind, 
                  <lb/>but she felt it was her duty to endeavor to draw him back 
                  <lb/>to domestic scenes and domestic peace. No answer was 
                  <lb/>returned until past one o’clock, when one of the clerks 
                  <lb/>brought up the following:

                      <lb/>suppose I dread your reproaches; I know with all your 
                      <lb/>boasted forbearance, you dare not utter any, or it is not 
                      <lb/>your regard to me would prevent you; but pray under-

                      <lb/>of my actions and person, and shall go out when and where 
                      <lb/>I please, without consulting your pleasure; mind your own 
                      <lb/>business, and don’t trouble yourself about me; you have 
                      <lb/>got a comfortable home, and may go out or come in, as you 
                      <lb/>please. But you cannot suppose, after the very polite me-
                      <lb break="no"/>thod which you took to turn Jessey out of doors, that I can 
                      <lb/>see you with any degree of temper; and since you have 
                      <lb/>withdrawn from her your protection, I feel doubly bound

                      <lb/>loves me with her whole soul; she has given incontestable 
                      <lb/>proofs, that her affection for me, supersedes all other con-
                      <lb break="no"/>siderations; and had she sooner been freed from her ma-
                      <lb break="no"/>trimonial shackles, you would never have been the wife of

                <lb/>when she had perused this unmanly epistle; she wrote a

                “That I am your wife, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>, is more my mis-
                <lb break="no"/>fortune than my fault. But you are under a mistake, in 
                <lb/>supposing <persName>Jessey</persName> loves you. No woman can be under the 
                <lb/>influence of that sacred passion, (whose power I can con-
                <lb break="no"/>ceive, though as yet I have never felt its influence) 
                <lb/>who degrades herself below even the pity of a man of prin-

                <lb/>pretended adoration into infamy, by inciting him to repeat-
                <lb break="no"/>ed breaches of every sacred and moral obligation. You

            He went out at two o’clock; I saw <persName>Sarah</persName> sinking under 
            <lb/>her mental sufferings, and put off my engagement to re-
            <lb break="no"/>main at home with her. It was nearly the close of evening, 
            <lb/>when a message came, saying, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> was going a 
            <lb/>journey, and desired clothes to be put up to last a fortnight. 
            <lb/>This was immediately complied with. We sent the next 
            <lb/>day to inquire for <persName>Jessey</persName>, and found they were gone toge-
            <lb break="no"/>ther!—that she passed for his wife in the house where they 
            <lb/>lodged, and went by the name of <persName>Hayley</persName>; that the maid 
            <lb/>and child were left at home; and that they said they were 
            <lb/>going a tour of pleasure.
          </p>
              <p>
                They having thus exposed themselves to open censure, 
                <lb/>I no longer hold myself bound to withhold the whole pro-
                <lb break="no"/>cedure from you. I intend remaining with <persName>Sarah</persName> during 
                <lb/>his absence. She has regained her composure, and mixes 
                <lb/>again in society; but she assures me, there is now no 
                <lb/>tie between <persName>Darnley</persName> and herself, but the strong sense she 
                <lb/>entertains of what is due to moral rectitude. How they 
                <lb/>will behave to each other on his return, I cannot divine.—

                <lb/>far, as to make her wish a separation; but she will never do 
                <lb/>that, as there is no state in the world she thinks so humili-
                <lb break="no"/>ating and pitiable, as a woman in a state of separation from 
                <lb/>her husband; the world ever ready to condemn, does 
                <lb/>not fail ever to attach some share of blame to the conduct

                  <body>
              <p>
                THE receipt of your letter, which assured me of your 
                <lb/>health and safe arrival at the end of your journey, was 
                <lb/>welcome, but I have felt little inclination to write, as I 
                <lb/>had no pleasant subject to employ my pen. You have en-
                <lb break="no"/>gaged me to write all that occurs in regard to <persName>Darnley</persName> and 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>; it is an ungrateful subject, yet when the 
                <lb/>heart is overflowing with anguish, it naturally seeks relief 
                <lb/>by pouring out its complaints to one who sympathizes in 
                <lb/>its pains, and ever was ready to increase and partake its 
                <lb/>joys. Ah! my dear <persName>Ann</persName>, how many of the former, how 
                <lb/>few of the latter have fallen to my share<choice><orig>. I</orig><reg>when I</reg></choice> review 
                <lb/>my past life, and strive to recall some pleasing remembrance; 
                <lb/>but it is in vain; for even in my happiest hours, when the 
                <lb/>vivacity of youth, united with the ease and plenty which 
                <lb/>reigned in my father’s house, might have been expected to 
                <lb/>have crowned every hour with felicity, the unkindness of 
                <lb/>my aunt, and some other painful circumstances, prevented 
                <lb/>my youth passing with that hilarity, which in general is 
                <lb/>the attendant of that gay season. At present, the uncer-
                <lb break="no"/>tainty I am in, in regard to the fate of my father, does not 
                <lb/>a little increase the painful solicitude of my situation. Had 
                <lb/>he not left <placeName>England</placeName>, I should never have been what I am. 
                <lb/>And indeed, when I dare think at all, I can only wonder 
                <lb/>how I ever voluntarily put on a chain, which had not even 
                <lb/>the shadow of a rose to hide the points and goads with 
                <lb/>which every link was armed. As to <persName>Frederic</persName>, I am hap-
                <lb break="no"/>py he is not here, were he to return at this period, I know 
                <lb/>not what would be the consequence; but of this I am cer-
                <lb break="no"/>tain, he would call <persName>Darnley</persName> to a very severe account; and 
                <lb/>I should become the object of public animadversion; per-
                <lb break="no"/>haps public censure; and certainly (humiliating idea) of 
                <lb/>public pity. <persName>Ann</persName>, to be pitied for the neglect of a husband, 
                <lb/>is something so nearly bordering on contempt, that I think 
                <lb/>were <persName>Darnley’s</persName> delinquency very generally known, I should 
                <lb/>wish to shrink into oblivion, and hide myself in the shade 
                <lb/>of obscurity. But while I am thus blaming <persName>Darnley</persName>, may 
                <lb/>not the fault have been in some measure my own? Yes! 
                <lb/>yes! I feel the fault is mine, and mine be it submissively 
                <lb/>to bear the punishment. You wonder, perhaps, to hear 
                <lb/>me thus criminate myself. My friend, was it not highly 
                <lb/>criminal to promise to love, honor and obey,—when my 
                <lb/>heart sunk cold in my bosom and refused to ratify the sa-
                <lb break="no"/>cred oath? It is true, I have endeavored to conform to his 
                <lb/><choice><orig>humour</orig><reg>humor</reg></choice>, to make his home the happiest place; but I ought 
                <lb/>to have known our thoughts, opinions, propensities, and 
                <lb/>pursuits were so diametrically opposite, that they could 
                <lb/>never meet in one point. I think it is not improbable, 
                <lb/>had he married a woman more similar to his own disposi-
                <lb break="no"/>tion, a woman, who loving him with her whole soul, 
                <lb/>would have not discovered his errors, or have been ready to 
                <lb/>overlook them, he might have made a more respectable 
                <lb/>member of society; but I have thrown away my own hap-
                <lb break="no"/>piness, and embittered his. Why was he so precipitately 
                <lb/>ardent? And why, oh! why, was I so pusillanimously 
                <lb/>weak and tame? Had he been at liberty when <persName>Jessey</persName> be-
                <lb break="no"/>came a widow, he would undoubtedly have married her, 
                <lb/>and both would have been saved from that gulf of infamy 
                <lb/>and perdition into which they are now plunged. But I 
                <lb/>forget I have as yet given you no information concerning 
                <lb/>the time and manner of his return; it was as extraordina-
                <lb break="no"/>ry as his departure. After you left me, I remembered 
                <lb/>your advice, and did not accept many of the invitations 
                <lb/>that were daily poured upon me; nor could any entreaty 
                <lb/>prevail on me to stay in a party after the close of the evening, 
                <lb/>lest I should lay myself open to the officious attendance of 
                <lb/>some person whose company might not be altogether pleas-
                <cb/>
                <lb break="no"/>ing, or proper. My time did not pass heavily: for I knew 
                <lb/>the necessity of endeavoring to bend my mind to my cir-
                <lb break="no"/>cumstances; and felt among other things, how happy I 
                <lb/>was, since free from tender feelings towards the person to 
                <lb/>whom duty and propriety would direct them, I had not 
                <lb/>been so unfortunate as to experience them towards any oth-
                <lb break="no"/>er, for that must be the height of human misery; to be 
                <lb/>wretched, and involuntarily guilty, to know you daily err, 
                <lb/>yet feel the total incapacity to suppress that error. From such a 
                <lb/>state, may Heaven, in its mercy, ever protect me. Ardent 
                <lb/>as my feelings are, what would be my sufferings. I say, 
                <lb/>the error is involuntary, because I believe it is not in our 
                <lb/>own power to awaken affection; and if we cannot call it 
                <lb/>into existence, it follows of course, when accident or an in-
                <lb break="no"/>tercourse with a person of similar disposition with ourselves, 
                <lb/>or whose various attractions have aroused it, it is not in 
                <lb/>our power to annihilate it. Yet do not misunderstand me, 
                <lb/>I am by no means an advocate for those who suffer them-
                <lb break="no"/>selves to be hurried away by their passions, and plead an 
                <lb/>inability to conquer them. No, <persName>Anne</persName>, this is the spirit of 
                <lb/>romance and folly. That the emotions of our hearts are 
                <lb/>not always in our own power, I allow, but our actions al-
                <lb break="no"/>ways are; besides, I do not think but that those who rush 
                <lb/>into guilt, and plead love as an excuse, are mistaken in re-
                <lb break="no"/>gard to the passion by which they are actuated. <persName>Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>says <persName>Jessey</persName> loves him; he is deceived; I cannot believe it 
                <lb/>possible for a woman who loves a man, with that pure, yet 
                <lb/>sacredly tender emotion, which I at present imagine real love 
                <lb/>to be, to suffer him to degrade himself in the eyes of the 
                <lb/>world; break the commands of his Creator, and infringe 
                <lb/>every moral obligation. Nor would she, I am certain, un-
                <lb break="no"/>less self gratification was the motive, render herself, by a 
                <lb/>breach of the first great feminine virtue, <emph>chastity</emph>, an object 
                  <lb/>of contempt to the man she professes to love, and whose af-
                  <lb break="no"/>fection must in that case form her whole felicity. But how 
                  <lb/>tedious I am, how unwilling to commence the tale you wish 
                  <lb/>to hear; and so it is ever, when we have any thing to com-
                  <lb break="no"/>municate that humbles us, and mortifies our self love.
              </p>
              <p>
                <persName>Darnley</persName> had been absent early three weeks, when one 
                <lb/>morning, when I descended to breakfast, I perceived him 
                <lb/>sitting with his back towards the door, reading the paper, 
                <lb/>apparently with as much <emph>nonchalance</emph>, as if he had been at 
                <lb/>home all the time, and nothing disagreeable had taken 
                <lb/>place. I felt an involuntary shudder, and something like 
                <lb/>indignation arose in my bosom, and burnt upon my cheek
                <lb/>—but prudence bade me repress these emotions, and re-
                <lb break="no"/>ceive him with that complacency, as might make him feel 
                <lb/>I had forgiven past transactions, and wished to live in peace.
              </p>
              <p>
                “You are welcome home, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>,” said I, half 
                <lb/>extending my hand towards him. He arose, took it with 
                <lb/>an appearance of cordiality, and saluting me, said, “he 
                <lb/>was glad to see me look so well. I came into town very 
                <lb/>late last night,” said he, “and would not disturb your re-
                <lb break="no"/>pose by knocking you up at three o’clock”—(very conside-
                <lb break="no"/>rate all at once, was he not, <persName>Ann</persName>?) I smiled, and enquired 
                <lb/>if he had had a pleasant journey? “Yes,” was the reply, “on-
                <lb break="no"/>ly he was detained by some disagreeable business longer than 
                <lb/>he expected.”—We chatted on indifferent subjects during 
                <lb/>breakfast, with much complacency on both sides; he told 
                <lb/>me he had invited a large party of gentlemen to dinner. —
                <lb/>“I will order preparations to be made,” said I, “but now 
                <lb/>I have an opportunity, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>, permit me to mention 
                <lb/>that our house-keeping bills run very high; the trades-
                <lb/>people want their money; and some of them are quite im-
                <lb break="no"/>portunate. I have received no money on that account for 
                <lb/>some time, and am really entirely out of cash.” “You 
                <lb/>must be very extravagant then,” said he, petulantly, “how 
                <lb/>much do you think you owe?” “I cannot tell exactly, but 
                <lb/>I believe between three and four hundred pounds;” “And 
                <lb/>where the devil, <persName>Sarah</persName>, do you thing I can get three or four 
                <lb/>hundred pounds? I did not expect you owed more than 
                <lb/>one.” “I am sorry you think me extravagant, but”—”Oh, 
                <lb/>you have an excuse ready, I dare say; women are never at 
                <lb/>a loss for that; but I will not be teazed and dunned in this 
                <lb/>manner whenever I am at home. When it is convenient, I 
                <lb/>will pay the people; until then, they must be patient. There 
                <lb/><choice><orig>is</orig><reg>are</reg></choice> ten guineas”—continued he, throwing the money on the 
                <lb/>table; “make the most of it; for I do not know when I 
                <lb/>can give you any more.”
              </p>
              <p>
                He then took his hat, and went immediately out. I 
                <lb/>went into the kitchen to give the necessary orders for din-
                <lb break="no"/>ner—as I came up the stairs, I met the head clerk in much 
                <lb/>consternation; he followed me into the breakfast parlor, 
                <lb/>and entreating my pardon for the pain he was about to give 
                <lb/>me, said he was afraid <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> was likely to break—
                <lb/>for that bills had been presented the day before, to a great 
                <lb/>amount; and that he had gone out this morning, without 
                <lb/>giving any orders how they were to be provided for.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hear <persName>Darnley</persName> below—I will resume my pen to-mor-

                YOU say you are uneasy; I do not wonder at it; yet I 
                <lb/>had neither spirit nor power to write before. When I closed 
                <lb/>my last letter, it was my full intention to resume my pen 
                <lb/>the next morning; but when that morning came, I could 
                <lb/>only add a promissory line, and send it away. I have now

              </p>
              <p>
                I will take up my narrative from the time when I broke 
                <lb/>off my last. The clerk’s information alarmed me, and I re-
                <lb break="no"/>solved, whatever might be the consequence, to speak to 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName> again upon the subject of <seg xml:id="a059" corresp="#n059">pecuniary</seg><note xml:id="n059" corresp="#a059"><term style="font-style: italic">Pecuniary</term>: of, or relating to, money.</note> concerns, the

                <cb/>
                <lb/>to dinner; we did not sit down until near five, and they 
                <lb/>continued drinking until seven; when they all started the

                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName> insisted on my accompanying them, it was in vain 
                <lb/>I pleaded the want of a female companion; that was obvi-
                <lb break="no"/>ated by one, who said he would go and bring his sister to go 
                <lb/>with us, and another went for two cousins—but neither 
                <lb/>sister nor cousins were women to my taste; and I shrunk from 
                <lb/>the idea of appearing publicly with such companions; but 
                <lb/>to argue was vain.

The <placeName>Old Swan Stairs</placeName> was a popular departure point for Londoners on their way to <placeName>Vauxhall</placeName>.</note> and entered the gardens about half past eight o’clock; 
                <lb/>we had scarcely made two circuits round the walks, when 
                <lb/>I observed a party of three or four women, dressed in high 
                <lb/>ton, escorted by an officer of the guards, and amongst 
                <Lb/>them, <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>. As they passed us, I turned my head 
                <lb/>the opposite way, and pretended not to see her; but <persName>Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName> touched my arm, and said, “did you not see <persName>Jessey</persName>?” 
                <lb/>“Where?” said I, looking another way.—“She is past 
                <lb/>now,” he replied, “but we shall meet her again pres-
                <lb break="no"/>ently, and she must not pass again unnoticed.” I ob-
                <lb break="no"/>served he laid an emphasis on the word <term style="font-style: italic">must</term>; and un-
                <lb break="no"/>willing to do or say any thing which might awaken the 
                <lb/>curiosity of my companions, I resolved, when we met a-
                <lb break="no"/>gain, civilly to give her the compliments of the evening. 
                <lb/>We met, I courtsyed with a manner formally polite, but 
                <lb/>judge my surprise, when, advancing with an air of free-
                <lb break="no"/>dom, she took my hand, and cried, “My dear madam, 
                <lb/>how glad I am to see you, and you wretch,” cried she, turn-
                <lb break="no"/>ing to <persName>Darnley</persName>, “where have you been these hundred years? 
                <lb/>I protest I thought you had taken a journey to the <seg xml:id="a062" corresp="#n062">Anti-

                <lb break="no"/>cer, sarcastically, “for he has, I think, been at your feet.”— 
                <lb/>She looked—but she made no reply. “Are you going to 
                <lb/>sup here?” said she to me, with the most easy effrontery. “I 
                <lb/>believe not,” said I, faintly. “But I believe yes,” said 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName>, rudely.— “It is as you please,” I replied; and, my 
                <lb/>dear <persName>Ann</persName>, I could hardly restrain my tears. “Yes, it is as 
                <lb/>I please, and I shall please to stay pretty late, so 
                <lb/>hold your tongue.” As this passed we had turned, 
                <lb/>and <persName>Jessey’s</persName> party had actually joined us. Oh! my 
                <lb/>friendly <persName>Ann</persName>, how I wished for your supporting pre-
                <lb break="no"/>sence: I think, had you been present, he would not have 
                <lb/>dared thus to insult me. <persName>Jessey</persName>, at least, would have avoid-
                <lb break="no"/>ed your penetrating eye; but surrounded by a gay, un-
                <lb break="no"/>feeling or unthinking, (for they are the same as to sympa-
                <lb break="no"/>thy) throng, my very soul sunk within me; and when I 
                <lb/>saw the triumphant, scornful looks of that unprincipled 
                <lb/>woman, I felt so humiliated, that I wished the curtain of 
                <lb/>everlasting oblivion to fall over me. One of the young la-
                <lb break="no"/>dies who accompanied us, left the arm of her companion, 
                <lb/>and coming round, took hold of mine. “You look ill, <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName>,” said she, “the crowd and heat are too much for 
                <lb/>you; let us turn down one of the unfrequented walks, you 
                <lb/>will breathe freer and feel more air.”— I gladly accepted 
                <lb/>her proposal; we had taken one turn, and were preparing 
                <lb/>to join our party, when we met <persName>Darnley</persName>. “What have 
                <lb/>you left your company for?” said he, “are they disagreea-
                <lb break="no"/>ble to you?” “<persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> was oppressed by the heat 
                <lb/>in that crowded walk,” said my good natured companion, 
                <lb/>“and I advised her to come here to recover.” “Oh! I 
                <lb/>am obliged to you, madam,” said my tormentor, “for be-
                <lb break="no"/>ing so attentive to her delicate feelings; she has at com-
                <lb break="no"/>mand, at all times, the most refined sensibility.” “Well, 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName>,” said I, endeavoring to laugh, as if I took what 
                <lb/>he said in pleasantry, “I will take care my delicacy intrudes 
                <lb/>not to interrupt your evening’s pleasure; but if it should, 
                <lb/>you must make allowances for the weakness of human na-
                <lb break="no"/>ture, and do as you would be done by.” “D—n,” said 
                <lb/>he, in an under voice, and being on the opposite side to my 
                <lb/>female companion, he actually struck my arm with his o-
                <lb break="no"/>pen hand—the blow was not heavy, but it was a blow; 
                <lb/>and I felt that it had broken the last small link that re-
                <lb break="no"/>mained between us.— Dishonored—insulted—struck! 
                <lb/><persName>Ann</persName>, <persName>Ann</persName>! I am a woman; the law will not redress my 
                <lb/>grievances, and if it would, could I appeal publicly? No—
                <lb/>I can suffer in silence, but I could not bear to appear openly 
                <lb/>as the accuser of the man I had once sworn to honor.
              </p>
              <p>
                My heart is full. I have sat down to write you a long 
                <lb/>letter; but it must be done at hours, when <persName>Darnley</persName> sleeps, 
                <lb/>heavy as my soul is, I feel at present something like the 
                <lb/>torpor of sleep stealing over my faculties; I will indulge

                WHEN the soul is oppressed by calamity, how little re-
                <lb break="no"/>freshment does sleep afford; the eyes close, the senses lay 
                <lb/>dormant; but the soul, ever active, finds no repose, it 
                <lb/>broods over past or present misery, anticipates future or a-
                <lb break="no"/>gain realizes past pleasures. Could a rational being for 
                <lb/>one moment doubt the immortality of that intellectual 
                <lb/>spark which informs and animates this mass of clay, let 
                <lb/>him ask himself, and clearly answer this question—why, 
                <lb/>when excessive weariness, or the natural exhaustion of na-
                <lb break="no"/>ture, or the more powerful effects of soporific medicine, 
                <lb/>has deadened, or suspended for awhile the animal func-
                <lb break="no"/>tions, the soul still preserves (if I may be allowed the ex-
                <lb break="no"/>pression) its elasticity, and bounds with joy, sinks with an-
                <lb break="no"/>guish, trembles with horror, starts with terror, and that 
                <lb/>in so great a degree, as frequently to force the body to par-
                <lb break="no"/>take its emotions, and laugh, weep, and even give articu-
                <lb break="no"/>lation to the impulses, by which it is then actuated? The 
                <lb/>deepest <seg xml:id="a064" corresp="#n064">casuist</seg><note xml:id="n064" corresp="#a064"><term style="font-style: italic">Casuist</term>: someone who uses clever but unsound reasoning, especially in relation to moral questions.</note> could not satisfactorily solve the enigma, 
                <lb/>and yet support the doctrine of total annihilation at the 
                <lb/>hour of death. And oh, my dear <persName>Ann</persName>, what a blessing it is 
                <lb/>to the wretched, that it is not possible for human sophistry 
                <lb/>to wrest from them that sure, that supporting hope?
              </p>
              <p>
                I return to the scene I was with my pen faintly portray-
                <lb break="no"/>ing, when I broke off to indulge the <seg xml:id="a065" corresp="#n065">lassitude</seg><note xml:id="n065" corresp="#a065"><term style="font-style: italic">Lassitude</term>: a state of physical or mental weariness.</note> of weary na-
                <cb/>
                <lb break="no"/>ture. We again joined our party in the public walk, and 
                <lb/>soon after the orchestra closed, we sat down to supper. 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName> appeared to be in excellent spirits, but I shuddered 
                <lb/>when I noticed the quantities of <seg xml:id="a066" corresp="#n066">Madeira</seg><note xml:id="n066" corresp="#a066"><term style="font-style: italic">Madeira</term>: a fortified Portuguese wine.</note> he poured down, 
                <lb/>for a state of inebriation ever rendered him more rude and 
                <lb/>insolent to me, as he fancied the only way to shew his su-
                <lb break="no"/>periority, and convince the world of his magisterial author-
                <lb break="no"/>ity, is to use positive <emph>will</emph> and <emph>wont</emph> upon all occasions, 
                <lb/>without condescending to give any reason why he will or 
                <lb/>won’t.— However, for this time, he was so taken up with 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>, that I was totally unnoticed. To be sure, 
                <lb/><persName>Anne</persName>, I must acknowledge she appeared in all her fasci-
                <lb break="no"/>nations, her dress elegant, her fine eyes and features beam-
                <lb break="no"/>ing with animation, her manners all life, all wit and whim, I 
                <lb/>could not help acknowledging how superior she must ap-
                <lb break="no"/>pear in the eyes of all surrounding, to the depressed, heart-
                <lb/>broken wife, who sat beside her. She laughed, sung and 
                <lb/>displayed all her powers of charming. At a very late 
                <lb/>hour, the whole party arose to quit the gardens. At the 
                <lb/>gate were a number of carriages, and we were obliged to 
                <lb/>walk some paces before we could get to the coach. <persName>Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName> led <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName>, and I was obliged to accept the arm 
                <lb/>of the young officer, much against my inclination; for 
                <lb/>being flushed with liquor, I saw he was inclined to be im-
                <lb break="no"/>pertinent. We had proceeded but a very little way, 
                <lb/>when I saw a man touch <persName>Darnley</persName> on the shoulder, and 
                <lb/>heard <persName>Mrs. Romain</persName> exclaim, “Heavens, what’s the mat-
                <lb break="no"/>ter?” In a moment, all was confusion. The bailiff, for 
                <lb/>such he proved to be, obliged him to go into a coach 
                <lb/>which he had ready, and into which I followed him, ac-
                <lb break="no"/>companied by two of the most uncouth, vulgar looking 
                <lb/>men that ever I beheld. <persName>Jessey</persName> either did, or pretended to 
                <lb/>faint, as we drove away. We were conveyed to a misera-
                <lb break="no"/>ble house, kept by the man who served the writ; a room 
                <lb/>was provided, the hostess taking care to assure herself that 
                <lb/>we had money to pay for it. <persName>Darnley</persName> threw himself on 
                <lb/>the bed, and spite of his situation, spite of the dreadful 
                <lb/><choice><orig>gulph</orig><reg>gulf</reg></choice> of ruin which now gaped ready to receive him, in 
                <lb/>less than twenty minutes was in a profound sleep. I trav-
                <lb break="no"/>ersed the chamber for some time, and eased my almost burst-
                <lb break="no"/>ing heart, by an uninterrupted flood of tears.  About day-
                <lb break="no"/>light, I laid down for half an hour, but the noise in the 
                <lb/>house and street, soon chased the slumber that had fallen on 
                <lb/>my heavy eyelids. I perceived he was awake. “At whose 
                <lb/>suit are you arrested, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>?” said I. “At the suit 
                <lb/>of one of your tradesmen, madam,” he replied, “I always 
                <lb/>thought your extravagance would bring me to a prison.” 
                <lb/>“If there is no deficiency but what my thoughtlessness may 
                <lb/>have occasioned,” said I, “the amount of the whole is so 
                <lb/>trifling, I should imagine it would not be difficult to raise 
                <lb/>the requisite sum.” “But there are deficiencies every where,” 
                <lb/>said he furiously, “and I must be a bankrupt, house, fur-
                <lb break="no"/>niture, every thing must be given up; we must go to lodg-
                <lb break="no"/>ings, and God knows how we are to live when we get there.” 
                <lb/>He seemed a little softened at this reflection, and continued in 
                <lb/>a milder key: “I think, Sarah, you had better go home this 
                <lb/>morning, perhaps the ruin has not reached so far as a 
                <lb/>general execution, and you may snatch a few trifles for 
                <lb/>yourself and me from the general desolation.” “I will take 
                <lb/>a few <choice><orig>cloaths</orig><reg>clothes</reg></choice>,” said I, “but I will not touch any thing 
                <lb/>valuable, the sale of which might assist in satisfying the 
                <lb/>creditors.—As to the future means of subsistence, I have 
                <lb/>no doubt but some way will open, and you will again see 
                <lb/>prosperity; I shall be willing to join your efforts.” “Oh! 
                <lb/>to be sure,” he cried hastily,—”you are very willing, and 
                <lb/>very able to work, you, who are too proud to fetch water 
                <lb/>to wash your own hands.”— “But I could have done it, 
                <lb/><persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>, and will cheerfully perform that necessary 
                <lb/>office for you and myself too, since we shall no longer be a-
                <lb break="no"/>ble to keep a servant; and not only that, but engage in any 
                <lb/>employment which might be serviceable.” “And what the 
                <lb/>devil can you do,” he replied, “come, I wish you would 
                <lb/>go home.” I rang the bell. “What do you want?” said 
                <lb/>he ‘some one to call me a coach.’ “Why cannot you 
                <lb/>walk?”— “What, at this hour in the morning? In this 
                <lb/>dress?—nearly a mile and a half through London streets?” 
                <lb/>“Aye, there it is, I suppose this is a specimen of your hu-
                <lb break="no"/>mility and economy!” “Good heavens, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>,” 
                <lb/>said I, “how can you be so unfeeling?— we are likely to 
                <lb/>be involved in much actual misery, do not let us augment 
                <lb/>it by our own fretfulness and impatience. I cannot— will 
                <lb/>not walk this morning—In future, you shall see I can 
                <lb/>bring myself to submit to every situation in which it shall 
                <lb/>please Providence to place me.”    [<hi rend="italic">To be continued</hi>.]

                A COACH being procured, I went home; the domes-
                <lb break="no"/>tics met me with tearful eyes, the clerks looked grieved, 
                <lb/>and the whole house appeared a scene of confusion; the 
                <lb/>glasses and china were taken down in the parlor, and 
                <lb/>stood in heaps on the tables. I ran up stairs; the draw-
                <lb break="no"/>ing room was in equal disorder; the young woman, who 
                <lb/>more particularly was employed in my apartment, came 
                <lb/>to me and begged me not to go up into the bed-chambers; 
                <lb/>“it will break your heart, ma’am,” said she. “When did 
                <lb/>this scene of desolation begin?” I asked. “You had scarce-
                <lb break="no"/>ly been out an hour last evening,” she replied, “when hear-
                <lb break="no"/>ing a little noise in the compting-house, I listened, and 
                <lb/>heard a man say, he had law for what he did, and present-
                <lb break="no"/>ly the head clerk came and asked me if I knew where my 
                <lb/>master was gone? “There is said work, <persName>Nancy</persName>,’ said he, 
                <lb/>‘there is an execution come into the house; I hope <persName>Mr. 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName> will not be out late; perhaps if he was at home, 
                <lb/>something might be done to prevent the depredations of 
                <lb/>these harpies of the law.’— But oh! dear ma’am, when 
                <lb/>one hour went away after another, and you nor my mas-
                <lb break="no"/>ter did not come home, when I saw the day dawn, and 
                <lb/>the sun rise, and heard soon after that master had been ar-
                <lb break="no"/>rested, and you were gone with him to prison, I thought I 
                <lb/>should have cried myself sick, if I had but known where 
                <lb/>to come to, I would have brought you some morning 
                <lb/>clothes; do now, ma’am, go to my mother’s, and let me bring 
                <lb/>your clothes to you.” “Do you not know, <persName>Nancy</persName>,” said I, 
                <lb/>“that I have no clothes but what I have on? the rest are 
                <lb/>all seized with the furniture and plate of the house.” The 
                <lb/>poor girl burst into an agony of tears; I bade her not fret, 
                <lb/>and told her I would take care she did not lose her wages. 
                <lb/>“That is not what I cry for,” she replied, “you have been 
                <lb/>so kind to me, if I never get a farthing more—but what 
                <lb/>will you do?— Let me go with you, ma’am, wherever you 
                <lb/>go; I will serve you for less wages than I would any other 
                <lb/>person.” —The artless, pathetic strain of this affectionate 
                <lb/>girl, I must own, strongly affected my feelings; but I 
                <lb/>struggled to suppress the rising burst of agony, and went 
                <lb/>up to my own apartment. I perceived a seal had been put 
                <lb/>on all the drawers, bureaus, &amp;c. and upon summoning 
                <lb/>courage to request permission to take a change of clothes 
                <lb/>from a linen press, was positively refused. Fortunately, 
                <lb/><persName>Nancy</persName> recollected that there was a considerable number 
                <lb/>of clothes at the laundress’s, and hastily went to procure 
                <lb/>me a change, which she took to her mother’s, who lived in 
                <lb/>the neighbourhood. Coming out of my own room, I turn-
                <lb break="no"/>ed to take a last look at the little white room, where you 
                <lb/>always slept, and in making the furniture of which, we 
                <lb/>were so cheerful and happy, forming plans of amusement, 
                <lb/>sometimes working, sometimes reading, and often chasing 
                <lb/>the hours with music. The bed was taken down; the 
                <lb/>curtains lay in a heap in the corner of the room, and an 
                <lb/>ill looking fellow was taking down those drawings with 
                <lb/>which I had decorated this favorite room, and on which 
                <lb/>you were pleased to set so high a value.—“I should like to 
                <lb/>have those trifles,” said I, “they can be of no value to the 
                <lb/>creditors, and I have a friend who would prize them very 
                <lb/>highly.” “You would like to have them, would you,” 
                <lb/>said the unfeeling man, “perhaps you would like to have 
                <lb/>this trifle also,” said he, taking my watch from his pocket, 
                <lb/>which I had unfortunately left at the head of my bed 
                <lb/>when I went out the day before. It was my mother’s 
                <lb/>watch, and my father’s picture was suspended from it; I 
                <lb/>felt my fortitude give way at this unprovoked insolence, 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>and turned away, that the man might not triumph in my 
                <lb/>evident humiliation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <persName>Nancy</persName> having returned from the laundress’s, I left my 
                <lb/>home—my dearly purchased home— and went to her 
                <lb/>mother’s; changed my clothes, and taking her with me, 
                <lb/>with a bundle of linen for <persName>Darnley</persName>, I walked back to his 
                <lb/>place of confinement. I found he had been taking steps 
                <lb/>for his liberation, several of his intimates had been with 
                <lb/>him; a lawyer had been sent for, and things put in a train 
                <lb/>for declaring him a bankrupt. But liberty was not so ea-
                <lb break="no"/>sily attainable as he imagined, many detainers having 
                <lb/>been lodged against him: and it was thought advisable 
                <lb/>for him to remain where he was, until his creditors were a 
                <lb/>little appeased, and brought to a disposition likely not to 
                <lb/>oppose his certificate being signed.—it has been a miser-
                <lb break="no"/>able period for me; I live in the hope of being soon en-
                <lb break="no"/>franchised; but until that event happens, must endeavor 
                <lb/>to bear his ill humor as patiently as I can; and when he 
                <lb/>is wrapped in the arms of sleep, or carousing with com-
                <lb break="no"/>panions as thoughtless as himself in the public room, solace 
                <lb/>myself with conversing in idea with my dear <persName>Ann</persName>; nay, 
                <lb/>it is more than idea, it is reality; only that I cannot hear 
                <lb/>the tones of that soothing, comforting voice, which has so 
                <lb/>often said to my perturbed spirits, “peace, be still!” and 
                <lb/>like the harp of the inspired musician, it caused the tempest 
                <lb/>of the soul to subside into perfect calm. Even now, dis-
                <lb break="no"/>tant as I am from you, the remembrance of your firmness, 
                <lb/>mildness, and intrepid resolution upon every occasion, ani-
                <lb break="no"/>mates me to endeavor to emulate so bright an example. I 
                <lb/>sometimes look back on my past life, and think what I had 
                <lb/>been, had not you condescended in very early life to notice, 
                <lb/>to reprove, to counsel me: to teach me to respect myself; 
                <lb/>and in order that I might be enabled so to do, warned me 
                <lb/>to shun, with the utmost care, every action which might 
                <lb/>lower me in my own estimation.—Yes, I feel, while I can 
                <lb/>with confidence say, I have done nothing to forfeit the 
                <lb/>love of my friend; while I act right, she will approve, she 
                <lb/>will respect me;—though I may have acute anguish of 
                <lb/>heart, I am not entirely miserable.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have just met with something which has excited a smile.
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName> has been for some days more than commonly out 
                <lb/>of spirits, though not so churlish as I have known him; he 
                <lb/>has condescended to be amused by my reading to him, and 
                <lb/>not frequented the public room so much.—I was wondering 
                <lb/>what had wrought the change; when a letter was brought 
                <lb/>him, which he read in visible agitation, and then, as if una-
                <lb break="no"/>ble to conceal his feelings, exclaimed, “<persName>Jessey</persName> is gone!” 
                <lb/>“Gone,” said I, “where?” “To <placeName>France</placeName>.” —“What, back 
                <lb/>to her convent?” “No—no convent for her; <persName>Jessey</persName>, 
                <lb/>whether married or single, was not made for a nun.” 
                <lb/>“Well, has she taken her children?” “One of them.” 
                <lb/>“And where is the other?” “In the country, at <persName>Lord 
                  <lb/>G—’s</persName> seat.”—So, my dear <persName>Ann</persName>, by degrees I discover-
                <lb break="no"/>ed that the tender, fond, <emph>fainting</emph> <persName>Jessey</persName>, to pass the weari-
                <lb break="no"/>some hours while Darnley was in confinement, had taken a 
                <lb/>trip to the continent with <persName>lord G—</persName>, the ostensible rea-
                <lb break="no"/>son alleged, was to place her son in some foreign semina-
                <lb break="no"/>ry for education— and if she could travel in a chariot and 
                <lb/>four, with a footman, groom, and servant, out of livery at-
                <lb break="no"/>tending, it was certainly a prudent saving of her own mon-
                <lb break="no"/>ey, and a much more agreeable mode of making the jour-
                <lb break="no"/>ney, than either in an hired chaise or a stage coach.—
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName> was mortified. —“Don’t you think, my dear,” said 
                <lb/>he, after he had been pacing the room for about half an 
                <lb/>hour, biting his nails and whistling, “that <persName>Jessey</persName> has be-
                <lb break="no"/>haved in a most extraordinary manner?” “I see nothing 
                <lb/>extraordinary in it,” said I, “she wanted an excursion of 
                <lb/>pleasure, and a good opportunity to make one, with a rich, 
                <lb/>and handsome young nobleman for a companion, she could 
                <lb/>not resist the temptation.”—I do declare, <persName>Ann</persName>, when I 
                <lb/>had said this, I was half frightened out of my wits, for he 
                <lb/>turned pale with mingled anger and mortification. “And 
                <lb/>I suppose,” said he, “you are glad she is gone?” “Why, 
                <lb/>to tell the truth, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>, I am not sorry; though I 
                <lb/>care very little about her, she is perfectly indifferent to me.” 
                <lb/>“Oh, very indifferent indeed, only you were as jealous of 
                <lb/>her as you could well live.”—here he affected a laugh. 
                <lb/>I thought I had said enough, so did not venture a reply, 
                <lb/>and he presently left the room. So there is an end of his 
                <lb/>connexion with <persName>Jessey</persName>. And I hope he will be convinced 
                <lb/>she did not love him— with all the fervor and enthusiasm 
                <lb/>she pretended.— Oh, how degrading to the passion of love it is, that 
                <lb/>a woman, despising every moral virtue, violating every 
                <lb/>principle of virtue, or decorum, should dare to plead in ex-
                <lb break="no"/>cuse for her libertinism, that she acted under its influence.  
                </p>
              <p>
                I will conclude my tedious epistle, by informing you, I 
                <lb/>expect to leave this dreary abode to-morrow or next day; 
                <lb/>I have been out and procured a lodging:—when I am settled 
                <lb/>in it, I will write again. Heaven bless my dear <persName>Ann</persName>, and 
                  <lb/>increase her felicity, in proportion to the happiness her 
                  <lb/>friendship has given.

                <lb/>our dinner in the kitchen, belonging to the family, is become 
                <lb/>the residence of your friend. I have no servant, <persName>Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>cannot afford to keep one; and I think you would laugh, 
                <lb/>could you take a peep at me in a morning, and see me 
                <lb/>bustling about getting breakfast, sweeping the rooms, &amp;c. 
                <lb/>&amp;c. I am awkward enough, Heaven knows; and as to 
                <lb/>cooking, I make but a poor hand at it indeed. <persName>Darnley</persName>, 
                <lb/>who loves good eating as well as any man I know, fumes 
                <lb/>and frets; well, he really has cause—but I intend to try 
                <lb/>my best, and learn all the profound mysteries of roasting, 
                <lb/>boiling, stewing, frying and broiling; then the compound-
                <lb break="no"/>ing of puddings, pies, and rich sauces. I beg your pardon; 
                <lb/>I forgot we shall have but little to cook, and, therefore, a 
                <lb/>very slight degree of knowledge in the culinary art, will 
                <lb/>suffice.—Now, my dear <persName><choice><orig>Ann</orig><reg>Anne</reg></choice></persName>, do not think it an affectation 
                <lb/>of fortitude, for it is not so; but I do assure you, if it was 
                <lb/>only for myself, I could be as happy in these small apart-
                <lb break="no"/>ments, and even with our confined income, as ever I was 
                <lb/>in my life. I am not debarred the use of my pencil, or pen
                <lb/>—to be sure, I miss my piano, but I have my guitar, 
                <lb/>which, together with my watch, half a dozen chairs, a 
                <lb/>small carpet, a bed and furniture, were sent to my lodgings 
                <lb/>by one of <persName>Darnley’s</persName> creditors, the morning after he was set 
                <lb/>at liberty. I say, if it was only myself—but <persName>Darnley</persName> is so 
                <lb/>mortified if any of his acquaintance call in, (for we are feel-
                <lb break="no"/>ingly convinced that the word <term style="font-style: italic">friendship</term>, is not to be found in a 
                <lb/>fashionable vocabulary.) I am not mortified when these 
                <lb/>flutterers, from motives of curiosity, or any other as pow-
                <lb break="no"/>erful, come in to stare, sneer, and take an inventory of our 
                <lb/>poor furniture; I feel so independent of them, and am so 
                <lb/>indifferent about their opinions, that I care not what they 
                <lb/>think or say. There are not more than five persons in the 
                <lb/>world, whose good or bad opinion, is of the smallest conse-
                <lb break="no"/>quence to my peace of mind; but of those few, I am tena-
                <lb break="no"/>ciously proud; a word, a look of <seg xml:id="a070" corresp="#n070">approbation</seg><note xml:id="n070" corresp="#a070"><term style="font-style: italic">Approbation</term>: approval or praise.</note> from one of 
                <lb/>whose judgment and sincerity one can have no doubt, is 
                <lb/>more soothing to the mind, more gratifying to one’s self-
                <lb/>love, than the most labored panegyric from those accus-
                <lb break="no"/>tomed to praise indiscriminately, without being able to as-
                <lb break="no"/>sign a reason for so doing.  But, my friend, though I feel 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>inclined to make the best of my situation, there is one very 
                <lb/>important circumstance, which renders it impossible to be 
                <lb/>entirely easy. I could be content with a little, but how is 
                <lb/>that little to be obtained? some method must be struck 
                <lb/>out; for, besides that, I think it the height of dishonesty to 
                <lb/>be running in debt when there are no probable means of dis-
                <lb break="no"/>charging those debts—and <persName>Darnley</persName> never sits down to meat, 
                <lb/>without reckoning how much it costs, and how soon our 
                <lb/>slender finances will be exhausted; yet he cannot restrain 
                <lb/>himself from his nightly visits to the tavern, and from 
                <lb/>thence, often to the <choice><orig>Theatre</orig><reg>theatre</reg></choice>. As to visitors, I am resolved 
                <lb/>not to encourage any, by persevering in the resolution of 
                <lb/>not returning any visits that may be paid me; though I 
                <lb/>imagine I need not trouble myself on that score, as we 
                <lb/>have no longer the means of offering them the sumptuous 
                <lb/>dinner or nightly revel. When I reflect on the short pe-
                <lb break="no"/>riod that has elapsed since my marriage, I cannot help con-
                <lb break="no"/>sidering it as a harassing, disturbed dream, from which I 
                <lb/>would gladly awake. Would to Heaven that I could do 
                <lb/>so;—but no! the feverish slumber must continue, and I must 
                <lb/>be hurried from one scene of terror to another without ces-
                <lb break="no"/>sation, until the torpor of death seals up each active sense.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was interrupted just as I finished the last sentence, and 
                <lb/>who do you think it was interrupted me? my <persName>aunt Vernon</persName>. 
                <lb/>“<persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>,” said she, “I am extremely sorry to see 
                <lb/>you in such apartments, and I am come to endeavor to 
                <lb/>persuade you to separate yourself from <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>.”— 
                <lb/>“Then pray, madam,” said I, gravely, “spare yourself 
                <lb/>the trouble, for it would be to no purpose.” —“You are 
                <lb/>very positive, <persName>Sarah</persName>,’ said she, “one would think you 
                <lb/>could have no great predilection for a man who has 
                <lb/>used you so ill, has run through all his property, and 
                <lb/>made himself a beggar.” “I had very little predeliction 
                <lb/>for him, Madam,” I replied, “when in compliance with 
                <lb/>your advice, and that of my other friends, I married him; 
                <lb/>he was affluent then.—If I bound myself by a sacred oath 
                <lb/>at that time, contrary to my own better judgment, to share 
                <lb/>his fortunes, be they better or worse, I will not now, in op-
                <lb break="no"/>position to my sense of duty, forsake him in the hour of hu-
                <lb break="no"/>miliation.” “But the world says he prefers other women 
                <lb/>to you.” “The world is officiously meddling.”—“Well, 
                <lb/>you ever was so self-opinionated, so head-strong, <persName>Sarah</persName>!” 
                <lb/>“Had I been properly so, on a certain occasion, aunt, you 
                <lb/>would not have been under the necessity of making that re-
                <lb break="no"/>mark now. But setting that aside, suppose I was willing 
                <lb/>to separate myself from <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>, how am I to exist in 
                <lb/>this state of separation? What can I do? Who will employ 
                <lb/>me? What friends have I, to countenance and protect 
                <lb/>me?”—The reflection was so cutting, my dear <persName><choice><orig>Ann</orig><reg>Anne</reg></choice></persName>, that 
                <lb/>I could not restrain my tears, and to my great mortifica-
                <lb break="no"/>tion, before I had dried them, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> entered the 
                <lb/>room. “What, telling over all your grievances, <persName>Sarah</persName>?” 
                <lb/>said he, with a sneer.—“No, she is not,” replied <persName>Mrs. Ver-
                  <lb break="no"/>non</persName>, “she is offended because I have been advising her, as 
                <lb/>your affairs are so embarrassed, to try to do something for 
                <lb/>herself, and for you to get some employment; and in short, 
                <lb/>for you to live apart.” “I think your advice very good, 
                <lb/>Madam,” said <persName>Darnley</persName>, with the utmost indifference. —“I 
                <lb/>believe I could get into a counting-house; but merchants 
                <lb/>do not like to employ married men, lest their expenses ex-
                <lb break="no"/>ceeding their income, might tempt them to be dishonest.” 
                <lb/>“I beg, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>,” said I, “that I may be no hin-
                <lb break="no"/>drance to your getting employment; I am willing to pro-
                <lb break="no"/>vide for myself if any means can be pointed out;—but 
                <lb/>while I do nothing to forfeit the title of your wife, to you 
                <lb/>I must, and will look for protection; as for the rest, I will 
                <lb/>relieve you from the trouble of providing for my necessities. 
                <lb/>I thank you, madam,” turning to my aunt, “for having 
                <lb/>pointed out a plan which I own I never should have thought 
                <lb/>of adopting; but I perceive you are better acquainted with 
                <lb/><persName>Mr. Darnley’s</persName> disposition that I am.” <persName>Mrs. Vernon</persName> was 
                <lb/>disconcerted, she took her leave in a few moments after; 
                <lb/>and then <persName>Darnley</persName>, by way of apology, began talking of 
                <lb/>the expenses of house keeping, and how cheap a single man 
                <lb/>could live, &amp;c. &amp;c.—And will you believe it, pleaded affec-
                <lb break="no"/>tion to me as the motive which led him to wish a separa-
                <lb break="no"/>tion, as he could not bear to see me employed in the ser-
                <lb break="no"/>vile duties of a family. I had no patience to hear him.—
                <lb/>Love me! No—he does not, and I am convinced never 
                <lb/>did!—I shall look round and try to find employment of 
                <lb/>some kind; when I have, you shall again hear from

           <div type="letter">
                  <body>
              <p>
                I HAVE transmitted to you, my dear Madam, copies of 
                <lb/>our afflicted friend’s letters, and I can easily imagine what 
                <lb/>your feelings were during the perusal of them; her last 
                <lb/>gave me more pain than I can find words to express. I was 
                <lb/>divided by my anxiety for my brother, whose weakness 
                <lb/>daily increased, and for my friend, who I perceived was 
                <lb/>bowed to the earth, by the unfeeling conduct of 
                <lb/>those, who ought to have protected her. I wrote her, 
                <lb/>bade her, if she thought it best, to leave her husband for a-
                <lb/>while, until more smiling prospects should make him in-
                <lb break="no"/>vite her home again, and come to me. I received no answer; 
                <lb/>my anxiety increased; I almost resolved to go to London, 
                <lb/>and enquire after her, but I knew poor <persName>Henry’s</persName> situation 
                <lb/>was so precarious that we had been more than a 
                <lb/>month, daily expecting his dissolution; this deterred me 
                <lb/>from taking the journey, though I need not have been ab-
                <lb break="no"/>sent more than two days. I wrote again, no answer; and 
                <lb/>uneasy as I was, I had no remedy but patience; indeed, for 
                <lb/>the last three weeks, my feelings have been so tortured by 
                <lb/>the sufferings and death of my beloved brother, that I al-
                <lb break="no"/>most forgot even my valued <persName>Sarah</persName>. This day week, his 
                <lb/>remains were deposited at <placeName><choice><orig>Southampton</orig><reg>Scarborough</reg></choice></placeName>, as it was his wish, 
                <lb/>that his body should not be removed. The next morning 
                <lb/>I set off for <placeName>London</placeName>, and immediately on my arrival, went 
                <lb/>according to her directions, to Greek <placeName>St. Soho</placeName>. I found 
                <lb/>her, but how? in a very confined lodging, actually em-
                <lb break="no"/>ployed in ironing her husband’s shirts; she looked very 
                <lb/>pale, but starting at my entrance, the crimson tide rushed 
                <lb/>over her face, and throwing herself into my arms, she seem-
                <lb break="no"/>ed to experience a kind of suffocating hysterical affection; 
                <lb/>it was neither laughing nor crying, but a mixture of both, 
                <lb/>which evidenced the depression of her spirits and weakness 
                <lb/>of her frame. “Why,” said she, as soon as she could speak, 
                <lb/>“why do you come here?”—To see you, my dear <persName>Sa-
                  <lb break="no"/>rah</persName>,” said I, “why have you not answered my letters?”—
                <lb/>“I had nothing either new or pleasant to write,” she re-
                <lb break="no"/>plied, “and I thought you must be weary of a correspon-
                <lb break="no"/>dent, whose whole topic was complaint.”—“You have 
                <lb/>been ill, <persName>Sarah</persName>,” said I, taking her hand.—“And you have 
                <lb/>been afflicted,” said she, tenderly pressing my hand in both 
                <lb/>of hers.—The tone of her voice, and the recollection of my 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>loss, operated powerfully on my sensibility; we wept in uni-
                <lb break="no"/>son. A pause of a few moments ensued, when she arose 
                <lb/>from her seat, put her work into the next room, stirred the 
                <lb/>fire, swept up the hearth, and going down stairs, returned 
                <lb/>with the tea- kettle; which, having placed over the fire, she 
                <lb/>prepared the tea things, toasted her muffins, and performed 
                <lb/>every little necessary office, with the uncomplaining meek-
                <lb break="no"/>ness of a saint, and with the case of one who had been ac-
                <lb break="no"/>customed to such employments. As I looked at her with a 
                <lb/>mixture of admiration and pity, I could not but think, I 
                <lb/>had never seen her rise so superior, appear so interesting, 
                <lb/>as in these domestic avocations. I have seen her move in 
                <lb/>a drawing room with infinite grace; I have seen her trip 
                <lb/>in the light mazes of a dance, with fascinating vivacity and 
                <lb/>ease; I have witnessed the elegance and propriety of her 
                <lb/>manners,when seated at the head of her table, she has per-
                <lb break="no"/>formed the honors of it to a numerous and splendid com-
                <lb break="no"/>pany; but never did she appear so engaging to me, as when 
                <lb/>having finished her preparations, she said, “Come, <persName>Ann</persName>, the 
                <lb/>tea and muffins are just as good now as they used to be, on-
                <lb break="no"/>ly the servant is not quite so handy.”  While we partook 
                <lb/>of the pleasant repast, she informed me, that she had been in 
                <lb/>search of employment, and at last heard of something 
                <lb/>which she believed she should close with. It was to go 
                <lb/>with an elderly lady to <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, to act in the double capaci-
                <lb break="no"/>ty of companion to her and governess to her grand daughter, 
                <lb/>a spoilt girl of about ten years old. “And will <persName>Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>consent to your going so far without a proper protector?” 
                <lb/>said I. “He made but faint opposition to the plan,” she 
                <lb/>replied, “and indeed, I am resolved to go, let the opposition 
                <lb/>be what it may, my mind is too proud to bear a state of de-
                <lb break="no"/>pendence on any one; and with all my faults, and I am 
                <lb/>very sensible I have many, I cannot bear reproach; it irri-
                <lb break="no"/>tates, it drives me beyond myself; gentle remonstrance, 
                <lb/>mild reproof, will bend me to any purpose, turn me from 
                <lb/>any plan, however I might have expected gratification in 
                <lb/>the execution; but to be treated either like a child, an 
                <lb/><choice><orig>ideot</orig><reg>idiot</reg></choice>, or a slave, is what I cannot, will not submit to.” I 
                <lb/>asked, if she had informed herself of the character of the 
                <lb/>person she was going with. “Why, yes,” she replied, “I 
                <lb/>have made some enquiries, and have learnt that she is a 
                <lb/>woman of respectable character; that she has a daughter 
                <lb/>very well married in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, and that she has in general 
                <lb/>resided with her; but about two years since she came over 
                <lb/>on some law business, and brought her grand-child with 
                <lb/>her; that being now settled to her satisfaction, she is return-
                <lb break="no"/>ing to <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, and wants some person who will assist her 
                <lb/>in the difficult task of governing her (to her) ungovernable 
                <lb/>grand daughter. As to the old lady herself, she seems a 
                <lb/>shrewd, sensible woman; her manners are not highly polish-
                <lb break="no"/>ed, but she possesses some conversable powers, and seems to 
                <lb/>have a thorough knowledge of the world.”
              </p>
              <p>
                I found any attempt of mine to alter her plan would be 
                <lb/>ineffectual, for she was resolved no longer to remain with a 
                <lb/>man, who had given her such evident proofs of indifference 
                <lb/>and selfishness. But I tremble for her, she knows not the 
                <lb/><choice><orig>world,</orig><reg>world</reg></choice> into which she is about to plunge; open, sincere, and 
                <lb/>without disguise herself, she suspects not deceit in others. 
                <lb/>This is a disposition most liable to imposition of any in the 
                <lb/>world, and where joined to great sensibility, is the source of 
                <lb/>undescribable anguish to the possessor.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have made some particular enquiries concerning this 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, with whom <persName>Sarah</persName> is about to embark for a-
                <lb break="no"/>n another kingdom; I cannot reconcile the idea to myself, that 
                <lb/>a tract of ocean will divide us; that in sickness or distress I 
                <lb/>cannot fly to her; that contrary winds may detain her let-
                <lb break="no"/>ters, even should she write on all occasions; but even this 
                <lb/>she will not promise. “I will inform you of my health,” said 
                <lb/>she, “but I shall not plague you with all the little cross inci-
                <lb break="no"/>dents which may occur, while I am acting in my double ca-

                You flattered me in your last, with the hope of my seeing 
                <lb/>you in <placeName>London</placeName>; it will, I assure you, be a very high grati-

                <lb/>proposed visit, I fear <persName>Sarah</persName>, will, long ere that, have 
                <lb/>been the inhabitant of our sister island for some weeks, as 
                <lb/>she thinks of departing the latter end of October.

                A MOST delectable voyage and journey I have had; 
                <lb/>bad weather, bad accommodations in the packet, bad roads, 
                <lb/>and bad tempered folks to deal with. Now is not this a 
                <lb/>bad beginning? Well, there is an old adage which says, 
                <lb/>“a good beginning often makes a bad ending;” and why 
                <lb/>not <term style="font-style: italic">vice versa?</term> We were six days crossing the channel, the 
                <lb/>wind blew tempestuously, and two or three times, I thought 
                <lb/>we should have been obliged to revisit the coast of <placeName>Wales</placeName>, 
                <lb/>whether we chose it or not; and that not in the pleasantest 
                <lb/>manner imaginable. However, here we are, all difficulties 
                <lb/>of wind and weather over; quietly set down in a very 
                <lb/>respectable lodging, in one of the most public streets in 
                <lb/><placeName>Dublin</placeName>. This <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> is a very different woman on 
                <lb/>this side <seg xml:id="a074" corresp="#n074"><placeName>St. George’s <choice><orig>channel</orig><reg>Channel</reg></choice></placeName>,</seg><note xml:id="n074" corresp="#a074"><term style="font-style: italic"><placeName>St. George’s Channel</placeName></term>: part of the <placeName>Irish Sea</placeName> which separates <placeName>Ireland</placeName> from <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>.</note> to what she was on 
                <lb/>the other; and to deal plainly, had I known as much be-
                <lb break="no"/>fore I left <placeName>England</placeName>, as I do now, I should never have 
                <lb/>thrown myself on her protection; but as I am here, I will 
                <lb/>remain a few months. I have no great prediliction for a-
                <lb break="no"/>nother voyage, though ever so short, during the season, 
                <lb/>when “the winds let loose, lash the mad billows, until they 
                  <lb/>foam and rise; threatening even heaven itself.” Indeed, 
                <lb/>my dear, there is no scene that ever I witnessed before, to 
                <lb/>be compared to the sublimely terrific grandeur of a storm 
                <lb/>at sea. The horizon, contracted by the black impending 
                <lb/>clouds; the angry scud flitting with rapidity through the 
                <lb/>sky; the liquid mountains rising to the topmast heads, and 
                <lb/>from their summit, pouring with tremendous roar, the 
                <lb/>white torrent, that as it falls, threatens to whelm in its 
                <lb/>abyss, the fragile bark. As the gloom of night approaches, 
                <lb/>to see on the leeward quarter, the black coast o’er hung with 
                <lb/>precipices, and fenced around with rocks, over which, the 
                <lb/>rude surge incessant breaks; to hear the wind howl through 
                <lb/>the rigging of the laboring vessel, which scarce can bear 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>the smallest spread of sail—then to reflect, that perhaps, 
                <lb/>before the morn returns, the vessel, crew, all! all! may 
                <lb/>be enshrouded in a watery tomb! No one can have an idea 
                <lb/>of the sensation that must, at such a period, prevade the 
                <lb/>mind, even of the most thoughtless, unless they have them-
                <lb break="no"/>selves been present at such a scene. And to me, it seems an 
                <lb/>impossibility, that any one who had once been in such a 
                <lb/>situation, could ever disbelieve the existence of a God, great, 
                <lb/>wise, powerful, and merciful. Who, that has once con-
                <lb break="no"/>templated his wisdom and his power on the world of waters, 
                <lb/>would wish to disbelieve, or for one single moment encourage 
                <lb/>a doubt?  But I beg your pardon <persName>Anne</persName>, that after having 
                <lb/>got you safe to <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, I have hurried you back, to make 
                <lb/>you pass a stormy night at sea, with a dangerous coast on 
                <lb/>your lee; but as you have escaped shipwreck, you may 
                <lb/>even come quietly again to <placeName>Dublin</placeName>; and setting down by 
                <lb/>my elbow, in a little room up two pair of stairs, which is 
                <lb/>but superior to a closet, in a very small degree; the furni-
                <lb break="no"/>ture of which consists of a <seg xml:id="a075" corresp="#n075">half tester-bed, a deal table, a

                <lb/>rush-bottom chairs; now, is not the apartment most ele-
                <lb break="no"/>gant? Come sit down, and be quiet, and I will tell you 
                <lb/>all about <persName>Madam Bellamy</persName>, and her fair daughter <persName>Madam 
                  <lb/>O’Donnel</persName>, and her sweet pretty, peevish, petulant, per-
                <lb break="no"/>verse grand-daughter, <persName>Miss Caroline O’Donnel</persName>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The old dame does not want ideas in her head, nor lan-
                <lb break="no"/>guage to express those ideas; but she is one of the most 
                <lb/>changeable, capricious beings, that nature ever formed. 
                <lb/>Her manners have been formed upon the scale of high life; 
                <lb/>and she certainly has, in early days, sacrificed to the gra-
                <lb break="no"/>ces; for even now, she can converse, with condescending 
                <lb/>affability, every word accompanied by a fascinating smile; 
                <lb/>she can be cheerful even to volability; persuasion will 
                <lb/>hang upon her tongue, and the genius of taste, wit, and 
                <lb/>elegance preside in her apartment. But see her two hours 
                <lb/>after, you will not know her for the same woman; her 
                <lb/>brow will lour, her large black eyes will flash malignity, 
                <lb/>the demon of spite and slander take possession of her 
                <lb/>tongue; and her language will be such, as almost the low-
                <lb break="no"/>est female would blush to utter. But this is a part of her 
                <lb/>character, which is only known to those, who are <choice><orig>unfortunate</orig><reg>unfortu-
                  <lb break="no"/>nately</reg></choice> inmates in her family; those who visit her transient-
                <lb break="no"/>ly, and only see her in company, think her all perfection; in-
                <lb break="no"/>deed, I had myself a very high opinion of both her head 
                <lb/>and heart, until I became a daily witness to her pri-
                <lb break="no"/>vate conduct; so true it is, that intimacy seldom improves 
                <lb/>our opinion of those of whom, from a slight acquaintance, 
                <lb/>we might be inclined to think extremely well; and I be-
                <lb break="no"/>lieve it is pretty much the case with us all. We wear our 
                <lb/>best looks, best manners, best clothes, before strangers; but 
                <lb/>carelessly assume our every day appearance before our in-
                <lb break="no"/>timates. No, there is one who, the more she is known, 
                <lb/>the more she must be esteemed and beloved; it is my 
                <lb/>dear, friendly <persName>Ann</persName>, whose face and manners are ever the 
                <lb/>same; only that those who are so happy as to see her in 
                <lb/>her most retired moments, will see her most amiable. For-
                <lb break="no"/>give me, you know I never flatter, but speak as I feel. I will 
                <lb/>own, that I may be partial; self-love incites in us affection 
                <lb/>for those who are continually shewing us marks of friend-
                <lb break="no"/>ship; and we are apt to think highly of the discernment 
                <lb/>and understanding of those, who discover merit in us. 
                <lb/>Now this is not by way of apology for loving you, and 
                <lb/>discovering all your excellencies; no, it is to make peace 
                <lb/>with you for daring to tell you of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <persName>Madam O’Donnel</persName> is a handsome, tasty, shewy belle; 
                <lb/>dresses to the extreme of the mode, rouge’s high, and says 
                <lb/>any thing she thinks of at all times and seasons. Now do 
                <lb/>not call me scandalous; I have not as yet seen squire 
                <lb/><persName>O’Donnel</persName>, but I shrewdly suspect—But madam calls; so 
                <lb/>my pen and my suspicions must rest until another oppor-

                THIS elegant apartment, to which I had just invited 
                <lb/>you, when I was obliged to relinquish my pen, you must 
                <lb/>not think, is a sample of the rest of our lodging. Madam’s 
                <lb/>apartments are, in reality, very genteelly furnished, and 
                <lb/>consist of a handsome parlor, drawing room and bed-
                <lb/>chamber; within which last, there was a very pretty room, 
                <lb/>intended for a dressing room, but in which a bed was fixed 
                <lb/>for <persName>Miss Caroline</persName>. Here <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> wished me to sleep; 
                <lb/>but as I do not intend to have the hours I devote to rest, 
                <lb/>broken in upon by any one, I preferred taking up my quar-
                <lb break="no"/>ters in the room I have described. Here, when all are 
                <lb/>wrapt in the arms of sleep, and a dull silence reigns around, 
                <lb/>save when the drowsy watchman drawls the hour, or the foot-
                <lb break="no"/>step of the nightly reveller, returning to his neglected home, 
                <lb/>breaks upon the ear, I sit and muse, and write, and some-
                <lb break="no"/>times weep. Yet why should I weep; is it the remem-
                <lb break="no"/>brance of past happiness? No—no—for I do not remember 
                <lb/>any time so happy, as to have a wish that it should return. 
                <lb/>I have sometimes thought, circumstances might have con-
                <lb break="no"/>curred to have made my lot in life easier; but we are such 
                <lb/>inadequate judges of what would constitute our real felici-
                <lb break="no"/>ty, <choice><orig>that,</orig><reg>that</reg></choice> perhaps, had I fixed my own fortune, I should not 
                <lb/>have found myself happier, than I am now; and yet, <persName>Ann</persName>, 
                <lb/>when in early life I have thought upon a union for life, with 
                <lb/>one of the opposite sex, I have painted to myself scenes of 
                <lb/>domestic felicity; have been fascinated with the pictures 
                <lb/>fancy has portrayed, and simply thought time would, in all 
                <lb/>human probability, realize them. Alas! how miserably 
                <lb/>did I deceive myself! But of what use is this retrospect; 
                <lb/>the past is gone beyond recall; the present must be endured, 
                <lb/>be its infelicities what they may; besides, I am not the on-
                <lb break="no"/>ly unfortunate being in the world—thousands and thousands 
                <lb/>are more wretched, more depressed than I am. I have 
                <lb/>health; I have a tolerable portion of understanding, which 
                <lb/>has received the benefit of being cultured by education; 
                <lb/>and I have what not worlds could purchase, a tried, a val-
                <lb break="no"/>uable friend. Oh shame! shame on me, that with such 
                <lb/>blessings in possession, I should dare breathe a murmur for 
                <lb/>those, which an all-wise Being, perhaps in mercy, has 
                <lb/>thought proper to withhold from me.
              </p>
              <p>
                In looking over what I had written the other evening, I 
                <lb/>doubted whether I was acting right, in communicating ev-
                <lb break="no"/>en to you, the suspicions which had taken possession of my 
                <lb/>mind, concerning <persName>Mrs. O’Donnel</persName>; but circumstances have 
                <lb/>since occurred, to set aside those scruples, and I am at full li-
                <lb break="no"/>berty to tell you, that I do not think that lady is married to 
                <lb/>the man she lives with; or that his name is <persName>O’Donnel</persName>. In 
                <lb/>truth, <persName>Ann</persName>, I have got into a family every way uncongenial 
                <lb/>to my feelings, and yet I am so situated, that I cannot well 
                <lb/>leave it. But to proceed, and tell you how my suspicions 
                <lb/>first arose, and how they were confirmed. I had been with 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> several times, to her daughter’s house, which 
                <lb/>is a very elegant one, furnished in a most expensive style, 
                <lb/>with attendants, carriages, &amp;c. suitable to the appearance of 
                <lb/>the mansion; but in all these visits, I never saw the hus-
                <lb break="no"/>band. I inquired where he was, and was told he was a 
                <lb/>great deal from home, as he was a member of Parliament. 
                <lb/>I looked over the list, but did not see the name of <persName>O’Don-
                  <lb break="no"/>nel</persName>. It is strange, thought I, but I will not be impertinent-
                <lb break="no"/>ly inquisitive; time, which developes all mysteries, will ex-
                <cb/>
                <lb break="no"/>pound this. One morning, <persName>Mrs. O’Donnel</persName> being with her 
                <lb/>mother, her son, a fine boy, about three years old, standing 
                <lb/>up in the window to look out, suddenly clapped his little 
                <lb/>hands, and cried out, “Papa! there is papa.” I cast 
                <lb/>my eyes towards the street, and saw a chariot passing 
                <lb/>with a coronet on it; a gentleman and a lady were 
                <lb/>in it; the gentleman looked up at the window, and I saw, 
                <lb/>by the expression of his countenance, that he knew the 
                <lb/>child, though he took no notice of him. “Whose carriage 
                <lb/>is that?” said I to <persName>Caroline</persName>, who stood beside me. “<persName>Lord 
                  <lb/>Linden’s</persName>,” said she, and her face flushed crimson deep. 
                <lb/>“Who was that gentleman in it,” said I. “Papa,” said the 
                <lb/>little boy, without waiting for his sister to reply. “What, 
                <lb/>is that your father, <persName>Caroline</persName>?” said I. “No, not my—
                <lb/><choice><orig>His</orig><reg>his</reg></choice> lordship—that is Mr.—” “What is the girl stam-
                <lb break="no"/>mering about,” said <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, who just then caught 
                <lb/>a word or two of what we were saying, “can’t you tell 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, that your father is not in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>?” <persName>Caro-
                  <lb break="no"/>line</persName> blushed still deeper; and even <persName>Mrs. O ‘Donnel’s</persName> face 
                <lb/>wore a higher tint, than it had received from some of the 
                <lb/><seg xml:id="a077" corresp="#n077">best French rouge.</seg><note xml:id="n077" corresp="#a077"><term style="font-style: italic">Best French rouge</term>: During the first half of the eighteenth century, cosmetics were more popular in <placeName>France</placeName> than in <placeName>England</placeName>. This reference suggests that these cosmetics are imported, expensive, and, perhaps, applied in the French style (meaning with a heavier application and covering more of the cheek).</note> I said nothing more; <persName>Caroline</persName> was 
                <lb/>desired to play her last lesson, and the child was child for 
                <lb/>calling after his father. “Why, papa did not hear me,” 
                <lb/>said the boy. “It is well he did not,” said his mother, 
                <lb/>“he would have been angry with you, and me too.”
              </p>
              <p>
                These circumstances dwelt upon my mind—but I thought 
                <lb/>it most prudent not to mention them; though fully re-
                <lb break="no"/>solved to have my suspicions removed, or confirmed, I was 
                <lb/>determined to be watchful of circumstances as they took 
                <lb/>place. Two or three nights after this, we were at the play; 
                <lb/>and about the middle of the first act, a large party came 
                <lb/>into the boxes immediately opposite where we sat, among 
                <lb/>whom, I saw the lady and gentleman who had passed in 
                <lb/>the carriage. There was a young person with us, who is 
                <lb/>niece to the woman of the house where we lodge; to her 
                <lb/>I put the same question I had before put to <persName>Caroline</persName>, of, 
                <lb/><choice><orig>who</orig><reg>Who</reg></choice> are those? “In the box to the right,” said she, “are 
                <lb/><persName>General Parkinson’s</persName> daughters; that young officer who 
                <lb/>stands behind the General, is going to be married to the 
                <lb/>eldest; that handsome man, with a star on his breast, in 
                <lb/>the next box, is <persName><choice><orig>Lord</orig><reg>lord</reg></choice> Linden</persName>; the pale, delicate lady on 
                <lb/>his right hand, is his wife, and the lovely girl on his left, 
                <lb/>is his sister; I do not know the other ladies.” “One of 
                <lb/>them is <persName>Miss Meredith</persName>,” said <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, as unconcern-
                <lb break="no"/>ed as possible; “she is a lovely woman; but as to that <persName><choice><orig>Lady</orig><reg>la-
                  <lb break="no"/></reg></choice> Linden</persName>, she is such an unmeaning, cream-faced thing, I do 
                <lb/>not wonder her lord is sick of his bargain; she had a swinging 
                <lb/>fortune; and my lord was loaded with younger children’s 
                <lb/>portions; so for the sake of villas, parks, and gardens, 
                <lb/>he took the inanimate statue into the bargain.” This was 
                <lb/>said with a sneer, and was followed by a laugh at her own 
                <lb/>wit. But my dear <persName>Ann</persName>, can I paint to you the horror that 
                <lb/>thrilled my heart, as I reflected, that <persName>Mrs. Bella-
                  <lb break="no"/>my’s</persName> daughter was the mistress of a married man? For 
                <lb/>there was no longer room for doubt. This was the man 
                <lb/>her child called papa; one hope only remained, that 
                <lb/>she might have been a deceived woman, and that <persName><choice><orig>Lord</orig><reg>lord</reg></choice>
                <lb/>Linden</persName> was lately married. “How long have they been 
                <lb/>married?” said I. “Seven years,” was the reply. “Have 
                <lb/>they any children?” “Three, two girls and a boy” Great 
                <lb/>God! thought I, are men all alike? Is there no such thing 
                <lb/>as stability or honor in the sex? I endeavored to sup-
                <lb break="no"/>press the uncharitable thought; yet ideas would crowd and 
                <lb/>jostle each other in their rapid flight through my brain. 
                <lb/>Man—is it only the fault of man, that so much depravity 
                <lb/>exists in the world? No! were there no <persName>Romains</persName>, no 
                <lb/><persName>O’Donnels</persName>, there would be no <persName>Darnleys</persName> <choice><orig>or</orig><reg>nor</reg></choice> <persName>Lindens</persName>. Yet 
                <lb/>here, perhaps, I err, and throw too great an odium on my 
                <lb/>own sex. Who then is to blame? or on what must we 
                <lb/>throw the censure? —On poor human nature?—How 
                <lb/>bewildered is the mind, how incapable is the judgment, of 
                <lb/>deciding on these intricate points! Say, is it the fault of 
                <lb/>education? Yet we know, nature left to herself, is liable 
                <lb/>to the grossest errors; nay, will commit without repug-
                <lb break="no"/>nance, actions, which, in civilized society, are denominated 
                <lb/>crimes; even of the blackest dye. But it may be argued, 
                <lb/>it were better the mind remained in a savage state, than 
                <lb/>imbibe false reasoning and false principles, under the sem-
                <lb break="no"/>blance of proper information.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was sitting after supper, leaning my head on my hand, 
                <lb/>and musing on this inexplicable riddle, when <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> 
                <lb/>thus accosted me:—But it was a long conversation, and 
                <lb/>shall be the subject of my next.— <closing>Adieu. Heaven bless 
                  <lb/>and preserve my <persName>Ann</persName>.

                “YOU seem lost in the <hi rend="italic">profundity</hi>, of <hi rend="italic">cogibundity</hi>,” said 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, laughing, and laying her hand on my arm, 
                <lb/>“And pray what may be the subject of your meditation?” 
                <lb/>“I was thinking,” said I, looking full in her face, “of <persName>La-
                  <lb break="no"/>dy Linden</persName>.” “Humph!’ said she, ‘and I presume <persName>Lord 
                    <lb/>Linden</persName> and <persName>Mrs. O’Donnell</persName> were associated with the idea 
                <kb/>of her Ladyship?’
              </p>
              <p>
                “They certainly were,” I replied gravely— But to have 
                <lb/>done with “<hi rend="italic">she said</hi>,” and “<hi rend="italic">I said</hi>,” (which are ever to me 
                <lb/>the most tedious interruptions in telling a story,) I will pro-
                <lb break="no"/>ceed in my dialogue without them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps there was a small mixture of curiosity mingled 
                <lb/>in the association?
              </p>
              <p>
                A very considerable degree.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would gratify it, but that I suppose your <hi rend="italic">primitive puri-
                  <lb break="no"/>ty</hi> would take alarm; you would draw up your head, 
                <lb/>and contract your little consequential brow.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you fear that, you had better leave my curiosity un-
                <lb break="no"/>gratified.
              </p>
              <p>
                I do not fear it, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, because I know too much 
                <lb/>of the world to be incommoded by any obsolete notions; 
                <lb/>and I really should like to laugh you out of some of your 
                <lb/>antiquated prudery.
              </p>
              <p>
                If by my antiquated prudery, you mean my ideas of 
                <bl/>right and wrong, you will find it a difficult matter to laugh 
                <lb/>me out of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps an old woman may find it rather difficult, but 
                <lb/>be not too confident of your own strength until you have 
                <lb/>resisted the persuasions of a young, handsome, rich lover, 
                <lb/>with unbounded affection on one hand, and all the allure-
                <lb break="no"/>ments of affluence on the other.
              </p>
              <p>
                I should be in no danger from such a one, unless I felt a 
                <lb/>predilection for him myself; and it is not in the power of 
                <lb/>beauty or wealth, to awaken any thing more in my bosom, 
                <lb/>than a kind of distant admiration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oh, the heart is always thought invulnerable, until it is 
                <lb/>absolutely lost; but pray, my frigid friend, if youth, beau-
                <lb break="no"/>ty, and riches, have no power on that impenetrable bosom, 
                <lb/>what may the requisites be necessary to awaken it from the 
                <lb/>torpor of stupidity? for really. I think a woman without 
                <lb/>passion, is a kind of automaton, can speak and move indeed, 
                <lb/>but is absolutely dead to all the pleasures of life.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am not without passions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oh! I beg your pardon, you are in love with your hus-
                <lb break="no"/>band?—no, now I remember, that cannot be; no woman 
                <lb/>can be so tame as to love a man who had used her so ill.
              </p>
              <p>
                Did I ever complain to you, Madam, of his ill usage?
              </p>
              <p>
                No; nor to any body else that ever I heard of; but 
                <lb/>the world talked loudly; besides, has he not shown his 
                <lb/>perfect disregard for you, by suffering you to come here 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>without money, friends, or a proper protector? None 
                <lb/>but a madman would suffer a woman like you, in the 
                <lb/>bloom of life, with uncommon power of mind, and high-
                <lb break="no"/>ly accomplished, to throw herself in the way of tempta-
                <lb break="no"/>tion; unless indeed he courted opportunities to be fairly 
                <lb/>rid of her; which, I think, must be his motive; and I 
                <lb/>should advise you, if a fair opportunity occurred, to gratify 
                <lb/>him and choose for yourself another protector.
              </p>
              <p>
                I shall certainly so far gratify him, as to ease him of all 
                <lb/>care on my account; I am able and willing to support 
                <lb/>myself; and as to my honor, I am myself the guardian of 
                <lb/>it. As to choosing a protector, where shall I find one? or 
                <lb/>what right have I to connect myself with any man while 
                <lb/><persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Has he not broken through every moral obligation to 
                <lb/>you?
              </p>
              <p>
                That does not release me from the vows I made to him.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do you love him.
              </p>
              <p>
                No.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do you esteem or respect him?
              </p>
              <p>
                It is impossible I can in so high a degree, as the re-
                <lb break="no"/>lationship that exists between us challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                What then is to prevent your accepting the protection 
                <lb/>of another?
              </p>
              <p>
                My duty to God, and the respect I own to myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                She seemed struck at so firm an answer; looked silently 
                <lb/>and gravely at the fire for several minutes, and then asked 
                <lb/>abruptly, ‘Were you ever in love?
              </p>
              <p>
                No.
              </p>
              <p>
                Have you any idea of the force of that passion?
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, I believe I have.
              </p>
              <p>
                Again I ask, what requisites are necessary to awaken it 
                <lb/>in your bosom?
              </p>
              <p>
                What?—why good sense, good nature, domestic vir-
                <lb break="no"/>tue, liberal education, strong sense of moral and religious 
                <lb/>obligation; knowledge without pedantry; wit without 
                <lb/>rancor: a heart capable of experiencing all the fine sen-
                <lb break="no"/>sibilities which dignify human nature; and strength of 
                <lb/>mind, self denial and moderation, sufficient to keep them 
                <lb/>strictly under the jurisdiction of reason.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oh! hold, for heaven’s sake! a pretty formal, old 
                <lb/>fashioned piece of clock-work you have put together; do 
                <lb/>you ever expect to meet with such a nonpariel?
              </p>
              <p>
                I neither expect, nor desire it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why not desire it?
              </p>
              <p>
                Because, situated as I am, to know such a character 
                <lb/>would be to feel my own bondage more intolerable.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are a strange being, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>; but suppose 
                <lb/>this <seg xml:id="a079" corresp="#n079"><hi rend="italic">black swan</hi></seg><note xml:id="n079" corresp="#a079"><term style="font-style: italic">Black swan</term>: an unlikely or rare event or individual.</note> should appear, what would become of your 
                <lb/>fine resolutions then?
              </p>
              <p>
                Such a man, <choice><orig>Madam</orig><reg>madam</reg></choice>, would never endanger the breach 
                <lb/>of any of them—to merit his esteem, I must preserve his 
                <lb/>respect; to this end it would be my constant <choice><orig>endeavour</orig><reg>endeavor</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>to persevere and strive to excel in everything laudable and 
                <lb/><choice><orig>praise-worthy—sensible</orig><reg>praiseworthy—sensible</reg></choice>, that by so doing, I could only 
                <lb/>hope to retain his regard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oh, you romantic creature! do you really think that 
                <lb/>platonic love can exist?
              </p>
              <p>
                No. I am not talking of what is generally called love. 
                <lb/>I believe that the most perfect esteem can exist between 
                <lb/>the sexes, if the minds are properly rectified, without the 
                <lb/>smallest approximation towards criminality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, but we have lost sight of <persName>Lord Linden</persName>—shall I 
                <lb/>give you the history of my daughter?
              </p>
              <p>
                As you please.
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, I believe I must, for I perceive poor <persName>Caroline</persName> stands 
                <lb/>very low in your esteem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Will your history, do you imagine, tend to raise her?
              </p>
              <p>
                Why—y—es, I believe it may.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then I should like to hear it.

                She began; so take it in her own words—no, pardon 
                <lb/>me, not until next post.

                  <body>
              <p>
                MY daughter, (said <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>), was at the age of 
                <lb/>seventeen, married to <persName>Mr. O ‘Donnell</persName>, who was past thirty
                <lb/>—that, however, was of no consequence; a disparity of 
                <lb/>age, unless very great indeed, not being of the importance 
                <lb/>it is generally supposed to be to matrimonial felicity; es-
                <lb break="no"/>pecially when the superiority is on the man’s side. <persName>O’Don-
                  <lb break="no"/>nell</persName> was handsome, lively, and had the manners and edu-
                <lb break="no"/>cation of a gentleman; his fortune was not large, but this 
                <lb/>I did not discover until some months after their marriage. 
                <persName>Caroline</persName> was my only child I had a genteel annuity on 
                <lb/>which I lived, and her appearance had been always such 
                <lb/>that he supposed she had a very considerable fortune.
              </p>
              <p>
                Did you know he had those ideas?
              </p>
              <p>
                I knew but very little about the business until it was 
                <lb/>completed. My daughter was on a visit to a friend in the 
                <lb/>country; <persName>O’Donnell</persName> saw her, admired her, and persuaded 
                <lb/>the silly child to go off with him to <placeName>Scotland</placeName>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Had your daughter any reason to think, had you known 
                <lb/>of her intended connexion, that you would have disap-
                <lb break="no"/>proved, or endeavored to prevent it?
              </p>
              <p>
                I don’t know that she had; but she was the very child 
                <lb/>of romance, and loved every thing that wore an air of mys-
                <lb break="no"/>tery, and required a little manoeuvring to execute.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then I should call her the child of intrigue.
              </p>
              <p>
                The old lady colored, and repeating in rather an el-
                <lb break="no"/>evated key, the word <term style="font-style: italic">intrigue</term>, was silent for a moment, and 
                <lb/>then proceeded.  
              </p>
              <p>
                When they returned from this imprudent excursion, they 
                <lb/>came directly to <placeName>London</placeName>, and to my house. I was in some 
                <lb/>measure prepared for it; for the lady whom <persName>Caroline</persName> had 
                <lb/>been visiting, wrote me word of their departure, and she 
                <lb/>herself addressed a letter to me from <placeName>York</placeName>, where she stop-
                <lb break="no"/>ped a few hours on her way to <placeName>Scotland</placeName>. I received them 
                <lb/>with cordiality, and indeed, imagined I had no reason to 
                <lb/>be displeased with my daughter’s choice; as from every 
                <lb/>appearance about <persName>O’Donnell</persName>, his dress, his expenses, his 
                <lb/>equipage, &amp;c. I concluded him to be a man of independent 
                <lb/>fortune. The house I lived in was neat, but not spacious. 
                <lb/><persName>O’Donnell</persName>loved company; our style of living did not suit 
                <lb/>his extravagant turn, he one morning, about three months 
                <lb/>after his marriage, hinted that it would be more conve-
                <lb break="no"/>nient and agreeable to have a larger house, and more ex-
                <lb break="no"/>tensive establishment. “Well, Sir,” said I, “why then do 
                <lb/>you not take a larger, have it fitted up to your own and 
                <lb/><persName>Caroline’s</persName> taste, and remove to it? I am glad to have you 
                <lb/>continue your visit to me as long as is agreeable, but it is 
                <lb/>certainly time you thought about an establishment of your 
                <lb/>own.”—I wish, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, you could have seen the 
                <lb/>woe-begone countenance of the man, when I made this re-
                <lb break="no"/>mark; his cheeks lost their animated hue, his lips trembled, 
                <lb/>and deliberately setting his cup of tea on the table, he re-
                <lb break="no"/>plied, “I shall be happy, madam, to provide your daugh-
                <lb break="no"/>ter such an establishment, when you have paid her for-
                <cb/>
                <lb break="no"/>tune; you say it is time we thought of a removal, only that 
                <lb/>I have been waiting in daily expectation of your leading 
                <lb/>to this subject, and making this necessary settlement, I 
                <lb/>should have spared so protracted a trouble; besides 
                <lb/>which, I thought my dear <persName>Caroline</persName> would not wish to be 
                <lb/>separated from her mother; and intended, whenever that 
                <lb/>arrangement should take place, to have given you an invi-
                <lb break="no"/>tation to reside with us; and even now, if she prefers this 
                <lb/>house, we will remain in it, and shall be highly honored 
                <lb/>in having you make a part of our family; but—but—my 
                <lb/>wife must be mistress in her own house, and preside at her 
                <lb/>own table.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “When she has a house of her own, <persName>Mr. O’Donnel</persName>,” 
                <lb/>I replied, “she may do so, but I beg leave to retain my 
                <lb/>place and my authority over my own family; and to ex-
                <lb break="no"/>press my thanks to you for the honor you have done me 
                <lb/>in requesting me to become a visitor, where I have a right 
                <lb/>to command, but I beg leave to decline it. As to what 
                <lb/>you hint about <persName>Caroline’s</persName> fortune, I am at a loss to under-
                <lb break="no"/>stand you; who ever told you that she had any?”
              </p>
              <p>
                “It was a general received opinion in the circle where I 
                <lb/>first became acquainted with her; and when I, through the 
                <lb/>medium of a friend, inquired particulars of the lady at 
                <lb/>whose house she then resided, I received for answer, that 
                <lb/>her property was supposed to be about fifteen thousand pounds
                <lb/>—otherwise—” “You would not have married her,” 
                <lb/>I said with quickness. “By my soul, madam, had I not 
                <lb/>thought her secure in independence, I would not.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “Upon my word, she is infinitely obliged to you.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “She ought to be; from the first moment I saw her, I 
                <lb/>found my tenderness powerfully awakened; every succeed-
                <lb break="no"/>ing interview tended to heighten my admiration, and in-
                <lb break="no"/>crease my passion. But elevated as she appeared to be, a-
                <lb break="no"/>bove my hopes; educated as she had been, and accustom-
                <lb break="no"/>ed from infancy to all the elegances, all the indulgences af-
                <lb break="no"/>fluence could procure, I should never have dared to <choice><sic>breath</sic><corr>breathe</corr></choice> 
                <lb/>the smallest word that might have betrayed my secret, had 
                <lb/>she not, by a thousand innocent, indescribable actions, given 
                <lb/>me reason to think I was not indifferent to her. Nor even 
                <lb/>then, would I have been the selfish villain, to desire to u-
                <lb break="no"/>nite her destiny with mine, and plunge her into compara-
                <lb break="no"/>tive poverty; but being told, her own fortune would se-
                <lb break="no"/>cure to her those conveniences she had been accustomed 
                <lb/>to enjoy—I spoke, was accepted; and most happy in re-
                <lb break="no"/>ceiving her hand at the altar.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “And no doubt, Sir,” said I, “the hand of an automa-
                <lb break="no"/>ton would have been received with equal rapture, had you 
                <lb/>supposed it conveyed to you the right of receiving fifteen 
                <lb/>thousand pounds?”
              </p>
              <p>
                “No, by heavens,” he replied with vehemence, “I 
                <lb/>loved her for herself: and if in that particular I have been 
                <lb/>deceived, I only lament it for her sake.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “You have been deceived most egregiously; <persName>Caroline</persName> has 
                <lb/>no fortune.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “So <choice><sic>be</sic><corr>be it</corr></choice>,” said he, throwing down a pamphlet (with 
                <lb/>some emotion of chagrin) which he had been perusing 
                <lb/>previous to the commencement of our conversation: “So 
                <lb/>be it: I have a small estate in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, the yearly revenue 
                <lb/>of which is about two hundred pounds; if she will go with 
                <lb/>me thither, and be content with so limited an income, I 
                <lb/>will devote my life to her service and happiness; and by 
                <lb/>following the profession for which I was educated, name-
                <lb break="no"/>ly, the law, I will endeavor to add to the comforts, and 
                <lb/>may by industry, in time, even procure for my beloved 
                <lb/><persName>Caroline</persName> the elegances of life. And to convince you, 
                <lb/>Madam, that I had no intention to commit depredations on 
                <lb/>your daughter’s property; here is a writing, (continued 
                <lb/>he, rising and unlocking a small writing desk, which stood 
                <lb/>in the parlor) properly executed for a settlement: it only 
                <lb/>requires sums to be specified, and signatures annexed, to 
                <lb/>make it binding, even to the utmost extent of her supposed 
                <lb/>fortune.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “He must have been a man of a liberal spirit,” said I, 
                <lb/>interrupting <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>.
              </p>
              <p>
                “He was a man of the most consummate art,” said she.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Was your daughter present,” I inquired, “during this 
                <lb/>conversation?” “No,” she replied, “she left the room the 
                <lb/>moment it began.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “How did O’Donnell explain the mystery of his splen-
                <lb break="no"/>did appearances with his contracted finances?” I asked.
              </p>
              <p>
                “You shall hear,” said she.
              </p>
              <p>
                And so shall you, <persName>Ann</persName>, another time; but now I am too 
                <lb/>weary to add any thing more, but the most fervent <choice><orig>prayer</orig><reg>prayer,</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>that health, peace, and prosperity may be the constant at-

                “WHEN <persName>O’Donnell</persName> made this pompous display of his 
                <lb/>intended generosity,” continued <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, “I <choice><orig>enquired</orig><reg>in-
                <lb break="no"/>quired</reg></choice>, with an incredulous smile, why, if these were his 
                <lb/>intentions, he had not made application to me, and had the 
                <lb/>settlements properly executed, and been married in the face 
                <lb/>of the world, not artfully to steal my girl away; and hav-
                <lb break="no"/>ing made himself master of her person, of consequence be-
                <lb break="no"/>come the sole controller of her fortune. He turned very 
                <lb/>pale at this interrogation, but protested that it was at the 
                <lb/>earnest entreaty of <persName>Caroline</persName>, that he had forborne writing 
                <lb/>to me; besides, he added, “I was too conscious of the nar-
                <lb break="no"/>row state of my own finances, to wish a strict scrutiny to 
                <lb/>be made. I perceive, (said he after a moment’s pause) that 
                <lb/>you are surprized at the appearance I have made since my 
                <lb/>acquaintance with your daughter, I will account for it. 
                <lb/>I had an intimate friend, who from childhood had passed 
                <lb/>the chief part of his time with me; we were play-mates, 
                <lb/>school-fellows, and pursued our academic studies <choice><orig>together; his</orig><reg>together. 
                <lb/>His</reg></choice> inclination boding to the law, as well as mine, we fin-
                <lb break="no"/>ished our studies under the same practitioner; during the 
                <lb/>last year of our study, we purchased a ticket in the lottery 
                <lb/>between us, it came up a prize of two thousand <choice><orig>pounds; it</orig><reg>pounds. 
                  <lb/>It</reg></choice> was suggested by my companion, that with this sum, we 
                <lb/>might stand a chance, by good management, to get wealthy 
                <lb/>wives; and a bett was actually laid, which should get mar-
                <lb break="no"/>ried the soonest, and to the richest lady. We left <placeName>Ireland</placeName> 
                <lb/>together, and having arrived in <placeName>London</placeName>, equipped our-
                <lb break="no"/>selves with every thing becoming men of a certain rank—
                <lb/>He bent his course towards <placeName>Northumberland</placeName> and <placeName>Scot-
                  <cb/>
                  <lb break="no"/>land</placeName>, and I took a more westerly circuit. We separated, 
                <lb/>in order that our pursuits might not clash with each other. 
                <lb/>The first interview I had with your daughter, convinced 
                <lb/>me that there my pursuit must end—I must either obtain 
                <lb/>her for a wife, or return to <placeName>Ireland</placeName> without one; for it was 
                <lb/>my fixed resolve never to marry any woman whom I could 
                <lb/>not love, how splendid soever her establishment might be. 
                <lb/>You have now, Madam, my history; in it I have but one 
                <lb/>thing to blame myself for, which is, not informing <persName>Caro-
                  <lb break="no"/>line</persName> of my poverty, before the irrevocable vow passed our 
                <lb/>lips. But I have only to plead in excuse the excess of my 
                <lb/>passion, which would not allow me resolution to be sincere, 
                <lb/>lest by that sincerity I should lose all that made life desi-
                <lb break="no"/>rable: for it was death to reflect only on the bare possibil-
                <lb break="no"/>ity of being deprived of <persName>Caroline</persName>, or falling in her esteem.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “Well, Sir,” said I, “you have now to make the trial 
                <lb/>when you have put it out of her power to recede; for I 
                <lb/>do assure you, she has not more than three hundred pounds 
                <lb/>in the world; which will be little enough handsomely to 
                <lb/>clothe her.”—I then left the room; on the stairs I met 
                <lb/><persName>Caroline</persName>: “So you have made a fine piece of work with 
                <lb/>your <seg xml:id="a082" corresp="#n082">precipitancy,”</seg><note xml:id="n082" corresp="#a082"><term style="font-style: italic">Precipitancy</term>: a rashness of action.</note> said I, “your husband is a beggar al-
                <lb break="no"/>most.”—But it would be endless to recount all the alterca-
                <lb break="no"/>tions, bickerings, and ill nature, that succeeded to this ex-
                <lb break="no"/>planation. At length it was agreed that we should all go to 
                <lb/><placeName>Ireland</placeName>. I sold my furniture, and thought my annuity, add-
                <lb break="no"/>ed to their income, would enable them to assume a more 
                <lb/>respectable appearance. We settled in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, and <persName>O’Don-
                  <lb break="no"/>nell</persName> began to get into practice in his profession; but their 
                <lb/>annual expenses always greatly exceeded their income, and 
                <lb/>in less than three years, they were involved in debts and 
                <lb/>difficulties. <persName>Caroline</persName> had been noticed by some persons of 
                <lb/>the first distinction; and this kind of society obliging her 
                <lb/>to be expensive in her dress, he was continually upbraiding 
                <lb/>her with extravagance. At length, he was actually 
                <lb/>sent to prison; his estate, which he had previously mort-
                <lb break="no"/>gaged to its full value, together with his household furni-
                <lb break="no"/>ture, &amp;c. was seized, and <persName>Caroline</persName> thrown again upon my 
                <lb/>protection, with her daughter, who was born in the second 
                <lb/>year of her marriage. We retired to a small inconvenient 
                <lb/>lodging. <persName>O’Donnell</persName> saw no probable means of extricating 
                <lb/>himself from his difficulties. I did not think myself bound 
                <lb/>to maintain a man, who had acted so dishonorable a part 
                <lb/>by my child; he was left to endure the punishment due to 
                <lb/>his folly. In the mean time, Lord Linden offered his pro-
                <lb break="no"/>tection to <persName>Mrs. O’Donnell</persName>; his person was handsome; his 
                <lb/>offers liberal in the extreme; his manners most prepossessing; 
                <lb/><choice><orig>in the world.</orig><reg>in a word,</reg></choice> <persName>Caroline</persName> loved him.
              </p>
              <p>
                “You mistake, <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>,” said I, with a blush of 
                <lb/>indignation, “she loved her own ease; her own gratifica-
                <lb break="no"/>tion—and if in these distressing circumstances she left her 
                <lb/>husband, and threw herself into the arms of an infamous 
                <lb/>seducer, for the sake of affluence and splendor, she is the 
                <lb/>most contemptible of human beings.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “She accepted his Lordship’s liberal offers,” said the 
                <lb/>despicable mother, “and I advised her to it.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “Great God,” said I, elevating my hands and, eyes, with 
                <lb/>a look of astonishment and horror.
              </p>
              <p>
                “What!” said she, with the malignant grin of a demon, 
                <lb/>“you think yourself so pure and immaculate, that it is im-
                <lb break="no"/>possible you could do such a thing.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “No, no,” I replied hastily, “but may Heaven in its 
                <lb/>mercy never tempt me beyond my strength, or leave me 
                <lb/>to fall into such guilt and misery.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “Guilt!” she retorted, “<persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, I would have 
                <lb/>you understand that I think <persName>Caroline’s</persName> leaving her hus-
                <lb break="no"/>band was the most laudable action of her life.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “Do not say so,”—I cried—“do not let me suppose you 
                <lb/>so lost to honor, to virtue; I can hear no more—permit 
                <lb/>me to wish you a good night.”
              </p>
              <p>
                She gave her head a half scornful, half complaisant incli-
                <lb break="no"/>nation, and I retired to my chamber, too much astonished 
                <lb/>to sleep; too much depressed to weep.—<closing><hi rend="italic">Adieu</hi>.

                THE veil once drawn aside from a depraved character, 
                <lb/>when it is no longer conceived necessary to assume the sem-
                <lb break="no"/>blance of virtue, how soon it is wholly thrown off, and 
                <lb/>vice suffered to appear in her own disgusting form. So it 
                <lb/>is with <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>; she permitted the mask to be with-
                <lb break="no"/>drawn for a moment on the morning when the child point-
                <lb break="no"/>ed out his father; it was still further dropped at the play, 
                <lb/>and after the relation of her daughter’s history; after she 
                <lb/>had the effrontery to confess herself the adviser and abettor 
                <lb/>of her child’s infamy, she had no longer any measures to 
                <lb/>keep—I was shocked to find into whose hands I had fallen; 
                <lb/>for I had been so improvident as to come from <placeName>England</placeName>
                <lb/>with her, without any written agreement, or any specified 
                <lb/>sum being agreed on for my services, and I discovered upon 
                <lb/>mentioning the morning after the conversation repeated in 
                <lb/>my last, that I must return to my friends. She said, she 
                <lb/>imagined I should not think of leaving her until she had 
                <lb/>provided some one to supply my place, in regard to <persName>Caro-
                  <lb break="no"/>line</persName>. I perfectly remember, Madam,’ said I, ‘that I promis-
                <lb break="no"/>ed not to leave you, without giving you a month’s time to 
                <lb/>provide another Governess for your grand-daughter, or 
                <lb/><choice><orig>to give</orig><reg>give</reg></choice> up a month’s salary; the latter I am willing to do; 
                <lb/>but I must quit your family this evening.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon my word, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, you give yourself fine 
                <lb/>airs, cried the haughty dame, with a contemptuous sneer, 
                <lb/>her large black eyes flashing malignity, and pray what is 
                <lb/>the occasion of this mighty hurry?
              </p>
              <p>
                My reason is, Madam, that I feel a repugnance to remaining 
                <lb/>in a family, the mistress of which professes principles which 
                <lb/>I have ever been taught to hold in abhorrence. 
                </p>
              <p>
                You are more plain than polite, methinks.’
              </p>
              <p>
                Where would be the use of what you call politeness in 
                <lb/>this case? Let me allege what reason I please for quitting 
                <lb/>your family, after the relation you gave me last night, your 
                <lb/>own heart would immediately suggest to you the real one. 
                <lb/>I am sorry to offend you; I do not mean it; you certainly 
                <lb/>have a right to act as you please; and surely you will allow 
                <lb/>me the same liberty. I wish not to influence you by my o-
                <lb break="no"/>pinions and conduct, nor while I retain my reason, shall 
                <lb/>yours influence me.
              </p>
              <p>
                And in what manner do you propose returning to <placeName>Eng-
                  <lb break="no"/>land</placeName><choice><orig>;</orig><reg>;?</reg></choice> it is a long, and I think, go the cheapest way you 
                <lb/>can, you will find it rather an expensive journey—and you 
                <lb/>have not an immense sum to receive from me. You have 
                <lb/>been with me four months, which, at the rate of twenty 
                <lb/>guineas a year, which is the utmost I can afford to give, is 
                <lb/>but seven pounds; though to be sure, she continued with 
                <lb/>affected indifference, you may have resources of your own 
                <lb/>which I know nothing of; and indeed, I hope you have, for 
                <lb/>I cannot make it convenient to pay you just now; I have 
                <lb/>overrun my income, and have but a few guineas to last me 
                <lb/>until next quarter day.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was thunderstruck by this unexpected declaration; 
                <lb/>my heart swelled, my eyes were ready to overflow—but 
                <lb/>pride struggled hard to suppress them; and though I 
                <lb/>thought I should have choaked, I did not allow them to 
                <lb/>appear. As soon as I could command my voice, so as to 
                <lb/>speak firm, I said,
              </p>
              <p>
                I thought, Madam, you knew my situation, when 
                <lb/>I agreed to come with you; it was the depression of my 
                <lb/>circumstances forced me from my native land; I brought 
                <lb/>but three guineas with me, half of which I have spent, and 
                <lb/>I have now only a guinea and a few shillings in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why, Heavens! <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, said she, with a look of 
                <lb/>astonishment, is it possible that you have come here with-
                <lb break="no"/>out any money in your pocket? suppose you had been ta-
                <lb break="no"/>ken sick, did you intend to throw yourself entirely on me?
              </p>
              <p>
                No, madam! nor shall now trouble you; I will, even 
                <lb/>with the trifle I possess, quit your house this night; I will 
                <lb/>send word where I may be found, and when you can make 
                <lb/>it convenient you can send the money to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Quite independent and spirited, I declare—but reputa-
                <lb break="no"/>ble house-keepers are pretty tenacious who they admit <choice><orig>into</orig><reg>in</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>their families; you will not find it very easy to procure <choice><orig>a lodging</orig>
                <lb/><reg>lodgings</reg></choice> in a respectable house, and I should suppose the 
                <lb/>immaculate <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> would not go into any other.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not when I know the family to be disreputable, would 
                <lb/>I enter such a house; or if I had been deceived in becom-
                <lb break="no"/>ing an inmate with such a family, would I voluntarily re-
                <lb break="no"/>main after I had discovered my error.
              </p>
              <p>
                I said this with pointed acrimony, and receiving no fur-
                <lb break="no"/>ther answer than, Do as you please, in a tone of petu-
                <cb/><lb break="no"/>lant disappointment. I retired to my own apartment, and 
                <lb/>began arranging my few moveables, ready to make a re-
                <lb break="no"/>treat as soon as I had secured a place to retreat to. About 
                <lb/>eleven o’clock <persName>Mrs. O’Donnel</persName> came, and in a few moments 
                <lb/><emph style="font­-style: italic">Madam</emph> went away with her in the carriage. I descend-
                <lb break="no"/>ed to the drawing-room for some work I had left on the 
                <lb/>table; the maid was setting the room to rights, rubbing 
                <lb/>the furniture, &amp;c. Seeing that she had turned up the car-
                <lb break="no"/>pet as if going to scour the floor, I inquired if <persName>Mrs. Bella-
                  <lb break="no"/>my</persName> was going to dine out.’ “Yes,” said the girl, “there 
                <lb/>be a piece of cold beef mistress said we might fetch up for 
                <lb/>your dinner.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The morning was tolerably fine, I put on my hat and 
                <lb/>cloak, and sallied out to look for a lodging. Though I 
                <lb/>have been here long, I am almost a stranger to the 
                <lb/>streets of <placeName>Dublin</placeName>. <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> seldom walks, and I 
                <lb/>have an objection to parading the streets alone. I felt 
                <lb/>awkward—my poverty ill according with my appearance. I 
                <lb/>feared to ask the price of any apartments in genteel look-
                <lb break="no"/>ing houses, and felt an instinctive repugnance to entering 
                <lb/>the abodes of poverty and wretchedness. It also appeared 
                <lb/>to my harassed and depressed imagination, that having re-
                <lb break="no"/>sided four months with such a woman as <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, 
                <lb/>would throw such an <seg xml:id="a084" corresp="#n084">odium</seg><note xml:id="n084" corresp="#a084"><term style="font-style: italic">Odium</term>: reproach or shame.</note> on my good name, that none 
                <lb/>who set a just value on their reputation, would admit 
                <lb/>me into their houses. Irresolute, oppressed in spirit, and 
                <lb/>fatigued from the long disuse of the exercise of walking; 
                <lb/>I wandered up one street and down another, without hav-
                <lb break="no"/>ing courage to knock at a single door, though I saw on 
                <lb/>several “<hi rend="italic">Lodgings to Let</hi>;” at length in a small <seg xml:id="a085" corresp="#n085">chandler’s 
                  <lb/>shop,</seg><note xml:id="n085" corresp="#a085"><term style="font-style: italic">Chandler’s shop</term>: a candle maker’s store.</note> in a narrow lane, I ventured to make the desired in-
                <lb break="no"/>quiry. The shop was small, the lane was dirty; but the 
                <lb/>woman who stood behind the counter was perfectly neat 
                <lb/>in her person, her clothes were very coarse, but withal very 
                <lb/>clean and free from rags. A little girl about seven years 
                <lb/>old sat knitting in an inner room. When I asked the ques-
                <lb break="no"/>tion, “have you a chamber to let?” the woman eyed me 
                <lb/>from head to foot, not with any appearance of ill nature, 
                <lb/>but as if judging from my dress, what my character might 
                <lb/>be.
              </p>
              <p>
                “I have a chamber to let,” said she, in a mild civil 
                <lb/>voice, “but I do not think it will suit you.”
              </p>

                “I should like to look at it,” said I, pleased with her 
                <lb/>manner. “It would be giving yourself trouble to no pur-
                <lb break="no"/>pose,” said she, “for I do not think we should agree.” 
                <lb/>“And why not?” “I am not used to let my chamber to 
                <lb/>fine ladies, my little back room will not suit fine white 
                <lb/>muslin gowns and lace handkerchiefs.” I was just going 
                <lb/>to assure her that I was a woman of character, when I 
                <lb/>recollected I had no person to refer to, who would con-
                <lb break="no"/>firm my assertions; for it appeared that the very mention of 
                <lb/><persName>Bellamy</persName> and <persName>O’Donnell</persName> would ruin me with every one. 
                <lb/>As I paused on the step of the door, a woman came in 
                <lb/>to purchase some trifle; I turned to the mistress of 
                <lb/>the shop, and said, “Since you think we cannot agree, can 
                <lb/>you tell me of any place, where I shall be likely to get a 
                <lb/>room?” “What does the gentlewoman want a lodging?” 
                <lb/>said the woman customer. “Yes,” was the answer, “my 
                <lb/>room would not suit her.” “Dear me, ma’am, how lucky,” 
                <lb/>said she, coming up to me, “if you will just step to my 
                <lb/>house, only a little bit further up the lane, I’ve got a nice 
                <lb/>room, I would not wish to disparage neighbor <persName>Truely’s</persName>, 
                <lb/>but mine is for sure, a great deal more neaterer, and I 
                <lb/>does not keep a shop—but has a pretty little bit of a <choice><orig>parlour</orig><reg>par-
                <lb break="no"/>lor</reg></choice>, where you can sit and work, or read, or see an ac-
                <lb break="no"/>quaintance. You know, ma’am, every body has acquaintances, 
                <lb/>tho’f they be poor, as I often tells neighbor <persName>Truely</persName> here, 
                <lb/>if one is poor, they may be merry sometimes.” “It is like-
                <lb break="no"/>ly,” said <persName>Mrs. Truely</persName>, “that your house will suit the 
                <lb/>young person better than mine.” “I will go and 
                <lb/>look at it,” said I.—Upon examination, I found the 
                <lb/>room was tolerably comfortable, and presently agreeing 
                <lb/>about the price, I took down the name of my landlady, and 
                <lb/>the lane where she lived; paid her a week’s advance, and 
                <lb/>told her I would come in the evening—passing <persName>Mrs. True-
                  <lb break="no"/>ly’s</persName> shop, I was turning to inquire the character of the 
                <lb/>woman in whose house I was going to reside, when con-
                <lb break="no"/>science said, “What right have you to inquire the cha-
                <lb break="no"/>racter of another, who have no vouchers for your own?”—
                <lb/>Humbled, weary, and faint, I pursued my way back to 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Bellamy’s</persName>; where a fresh scene of mortification and 
                <lb/>humiliation awaited me.—<persName>Ann</persName>, <persName>Ann</persName>, my heart is swol-
                <lb break="no"/>len nearly to bursting, with mingled grief and resentment. 
                <lb/>Alas! what am I? whom can I look to for comfort? to 
                <lb/>whom shall I fly for protection, from indignity and insult?

                WHEN I returned to <persName>Mrs. Bellamy’s</persName> house in order to 
                <lb/>remove my trunk to my new habitation, the maid brought 
                <lb/>up my dinner, and while I was eating it, a porter brought 
                <lb/>a packet directed to me, and immediately departed. I was 
                <lb/>unacquainted with the writing, yet it seemed as if I had 
                <lb/>seen it somewhere before, though I could form no idea 
                <lb/>whose it was; I broke the seal, and found the two inclosed 
                <lb/>letters; I send you the insulting originals, for I have not 
                <lb/>patience to transcribe them; you see the situation they are 
                <lb/>in, I have wet them with indignant tears; have trampled 
                <lb/>them under my feet; I would have torn the infamous 
                <lb/>scrawls to atoms, and scattered them to the winds of heav-
                <lb break="no"/>en, or given them to the devouring flames, but I preserved 
                <lb/>them that you may see how low, how very low, your poor 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName> is fallen.

                    <p>
                    I AM exceedingly concerned, my dear <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, at 
                      <lb/>the little <seg xml:id="a087" corresp="#n087"><term style="font-style: italic">brulee</term></seg><note xml:id="n087" corresp="#a087"><term style="font-style: italic">Brulee</term>: literally burning, but in this context heated argument.</note> which has taken place between my mother 
                    <lb/>and yourself, especially as she tells me you talk of leaving 
                    <lb/>her; this I lament, because I think <persName>Caroline</persName> very much 
                    <lb/>improved since you have had the entire management of 
                    <lb/>her; not but that it has been a matter of surprise to me, 
                    <lb/>that a woman so young, lovely, and accomplished as your-
                    <lb break="no"/>self, should voluntarily submit to the humiliation of being 
                    <lb/>subject to the humor and caprices of any one, and live 
                    <lb/>in a state of dependence, when they might command af-
                    <lb break="no"/>fluence on the very easy terms of sharing it with an agreea-
                    <lb break="no"/>ble man, who would think himself honored by her accep-
                    <lb break="no"/>tance of his protection: and this I know to be your case. 
                      <lb/>The <persName>Marquis of <placeName>H—</placeName></persName>, who is an intimate friend of <persName>Lord 
                      <lb/>Linden’s</persName>, and whom you have seen at my house and at my 
                    <lb/>mother’s, has often expressed his fervent admiration of 
                    <lb/>your person, manners and accomplishments. He was pre-
                    <lb break="no"/>sent when my mother told us of your quarrel; I do assure 
                    <lb/>you he took your part very highly, called you a persecuted 
                    <lb/>angel; raved at my mother, and was setting off post haste, 
                    <lb/>to offer you consolation, in the form of a young handsome 
                    <lb/>lover and a settlement; but I stopped him, told him he 
                    <lb/>must conduct himself with prudence and delicacy, if he 
                    <lb/>wished to succeed with you—so while he is writing his 
                    <lb/>amorous epistle, I have scrawled these hasty lines, to intreat 
                    <lb/>you to give his proposal a fair perusal, and take it into se-
                    <lb break="no"/>rious consideration.— Only reflect, my dear, on the unpro-
                    <lb break="no"/>tected state, in which you now are, in a strange place, without 
                    <cb/>
                    <lb/>friends or money. You will perhaps say, you have reputation; 
                    <lb/>but, child, will reputation pay your lodging, or buy you a 
                    <lb/>new gown when you want one? No, believe me, poor 
                    <lb/>reputation is many a time left naked in the street, while 
                    <lb/>those who have disclaimed and turned her out of doors, 
                    <lb/>are sumptuously clothed, inhabit palaces, and ride in 
                    <lb/>splendid equipages. But I will say no more; your own 
                    <lb/>good sense will direct you; and surely I think you cannot 
                    <lb/>be so wilfully blind to your own interest, as to refuse the
                    <lb/>offers of the Marquis. Do, child, be wise for once, and 
                    <lb/>take the advice of a friend, though I am arguing against 
                    <lb/>myself to persuade you to do so. But if you are romantic 
                    <lb/>enough to prefer dependence; why, if you must leave Ma, 
                    <lb/>come and live with me, and I will take Caroline home; 
                    <lb/>at any rate, pray do not, in a flight of elevation, run from 
                    <lb/>those evils which you know, to those of which at present 
                    <lb/>you can have no conception.

                      THOUGH I have but a few times enjoyed the pleasure 
                    <lb/>of being in your company, those few have been enough to 
                      <lb/>awaken in my mind sentiments of the highest esteem for 
                      <lb/>your talents and virtues. I have understood from my 
                      <lb/>friend, <persName>Lord Linden</persName>, that you have connect-
                      <lb break="no"/>ed yourself in marriage, with a man who knows not how 
                      <lb/>justly to appreciate your worth; and who has permitted 
                      <lb/>you to come unprovided and unprotected into this coun-
                      <lb break="no"/>try, that by the exertion of your abilities, you may obtain 
                      <lb/>means of subsistence; this, madam, being the case, pre-
                      <lb break="no"/>vents my having the honor of laying myself and fortune 
                      <lb/>at your feet. But as from the treatment you have experi-
                      <lb break="no"/>enced from your husband, every tie must be broken be-
                      <lb break="no"/>tween you, every obligation dissolved; permit me to of-

                      <lb/>hundred pounds a year during your life, awaits your ac-

              <p>
                WHEN I had read these most diabolical epistles, my 
                <lb/>beloved <persName>Ann</persName>, the first impulse of my soul was to offer 
                <lb/>humbly, on my knees, my thanks to the Giver of all good, 
                <lb/>that this Marquis, this man who would thus artfully insin-
                <lb break="no"/>uate himself into my <choice><orig>favour</orig><reg>favor</reg></choice>, is not a person who is very 
                <lb/>likely to awaken the least emotion of tenderness; next to 
                <lb/>this effusion of thanks, an ardent prayer arose, that I might 
                <lb/>not be tempted beyond my strength. I then resolved on 
                <lb/>immediate flight. For what am I but a weak mortal, lia-
                <lb break="no"/>ble to error, prone to frailty, the very child of weakness<choice><orig>.</orig><reg>?</reg></choice>—
                <lb/>Beset as I was, by poverty, unsheltered poverty, in a place 
                <lb/>where none were interested whether I lived or died—far 
                <lb/>from all who are interested in my fate, my <persName>Frederic</persName>, and 
                <lb/>my dear <persName>Ann</persName>—-My father, oh! let me not think on him; 
                <lb/><persName>Ann</persName>, I feared my own weakness; and though not assailed 
                <lb/>by passion— I knew my safety lay only in flight—I sent 
                <lb/>for a coach, put my trunk into it, and without leaving any 
                <lb/>word for <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, drove to my new lodgings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secure and happy in the reflection that I have done 
                <lb/>right, I slept that night with tolerable composure; but 
                <lb/>each returning day brings with it some anxiety; for, alas, 
                <lb/>how am I to live?—I will trust in God. I am willing to 
                <lb/>work, I shall surely obtain employment sufficient to pur-
                <lb break="no"/>chase the mere necessaries of life. I will write to you 
                <lb/>again, but do not expect long nor frequent letters. I 
                <lb/>have now to labor for a living—-do not be uneasy—I 
                <lb/>shall do very well, no doubt.—Heaven bless you, my good, 
                <lb/>my friendly <persName>Ann</persName>. Whilst I live I shall never cease to love 
                <lb/>and honor you.

              <p>
                DURING your residence in <placeName>London</placeName>, my dear Madam, 
                <lb/>you saw every letter I received from <placeName>Mrs. Darnley</placeName>, and 
                <lb/>were witness to the cruel anxiety I experienced upon the 
                <lb/>receipt of the last, in which she informed me of her remov-
                <lb break="no"/>al from <persName>Mrs. Bellamy’s</persName>; though I highly applauded her 
                <lb/>conduct, I trembled for the dangers to which she might be 
                <lb/>exposed in her miserable retreat, and as she had given no 
                <lb/>direction how a letter might find her; however, hoping that 
                <lb/>she might send to the post-office to inquire for letters, I 
                <lb/>wrote, having first placed a sum of money with a banker, 
                <lb/>who had a correspondent in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, with orders to pay it 
                <lb/>to her; giving such particular instructions, that in case the 
                <lb/>letter should be lost, there might be no danger of the money 
                <lb/>being taken by an impostor. This money I entreated her 
                <lb/>to take and make what use she pleased with it, but by all 
                <lb/>means to come to <placeName>England</placeName>, where she might be within 
                <lb/>reach of those who love, esteem, and would protect her to 
                <lb/>the utmost of their power. Having thus done, I rested in 
                <lb/>quiet, until I imagined time enough was elapsed for an an-
                <lb break="no"/>swer to arrive, but no answer came. I then flattered 
                <lb/>myself that Sarah, in compliance with my advice, was on 
                <lb/>her way home; but a month passed on, and still no intelli-
                <lb break="no"/>gence arriving, I requested <persName>Mr. Lewis</persName>, the banker above-
                <lb/>mentioned, to write to his friend, and beg him to call on 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, and make inquiry concerning her, as I did 
                <lb/>not think it improbable that curiosity might induce her to 
                <lb/>trace out my poor, deserted friend, and endeavour to pre-
                <lb break="no"/>vail on her to return; or, by sending the insinuating Mar-
                <lb break="no"/>quis, (for such by his letter I am convinced he is,) to use all 
                <lb/>his arts in order to reduce <persName>Sarah</persName> to the degraded level with 
                <lb/>herself. Through this man I entertained a faint hope that 
                <lb/>I might discover where she was, and have the superlative 
                <lb/>felicity of relieving her necessities, administering to her 
                <lb/>comfort, and cheering her heart, by convincing her my 
                <lb/>friendship was undeviating, my esteem undiminished, my 
                <lb/>heart as warmly attached as ever. <persName>Mr. Lewis</persName>, though an 
                <lb/>excellent man, could not feel interested as I did in the fate 
                <lb/>of <persName>Sarah</persName>, and neglected writing for above a week; after 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>his letter was gone, it was three weeks before he received 
                <lb/>an answer; and when he did, it almost deprived me of my 
                <lb/>reason. I will give you a full account of <persName>Mr. Lewis’s</persName> vi-
                <lb break="no"/>sit to me, and then transcribe the letter which he has left 
                <lb/>with me. He was polite enough to call the very day the 
                <lb/>letter arrived. It was about twelve o’clock when a car-
                <lb break="no"/>riage drove up to the door, and seeing from the window 
                <lb/>that it was <persName>Mr. Lewis’s</persName>, I could not restrain my impatience, 
                <lb/>but hastened to the top of the stairs to meet him. ‘You have 
                <lb/>news for me, dear Sir,’ said I, reaching out my hand. —
                <lb/>‘I have received a letter from <placeName>Dublin</placeName>,’ said he, as he led 
                <lb/>me into the drawing-room, ‘but I fear it will not afford 
                <lb/>you any pleasure,’ continued he, as he seated himself. ‘I am 
                <lb/>very much afraid, my good <persName>Miss Aubrey</persName>, that your <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName> is an artful woman, who has imposed on your 
                <lb/>good and unsuspicious heart.’ ‘Did you know her, Sir, 
                <lb/>you would soon banish those ideas; she is so far from practising 
                <lb/>art, that she carries her sincerity almost to an extreme; nay, 
                <lb/>were she inclined to practise it, her intelligent countenance 
                <lb/>would betray her; for in every feature, in particular, her soft 
                <lb/>expressive eyes you may read every emotion of her ardent, 
                <lb/>though uncorrupted heart.’— ‘Well, well!’ said he, ‘I find 
                <lb/>you are an enthusiast, so will not argue the point with you. 
                <lb/>Here is the letter I have received; read it at your leisure; 
                <lb/>from the intelligence it contains, I am led to imagine you 
                <lb/>will change your opinion; indeed, I cannot but be amazed 
                <lb/>that you should think so highly of a woman who resided 
                <lb/>several months with a person of <persName>Mrs. Bellamy’s</persName> descrip-
                <lb break="no"/>tion; if she is innocent, the least we can say is, she has been 
                <lb/>very imprudent.’— I would have vindicated her; offered to 
                <lb/>produce her letters; but this he would not let me do, say-
                <lb break="no"/>ing, he would talk to me about it when he saw me again; 
                <lb/>he then left me, and with a palpitating heart, I sat down 
                <lb/>to read the letter.

                  <p>
                    <choice><orig>In</orig><reg>IN</reg></choice> pursuance of your advice, I sought out <persName>Mrs. Bel-
                      <lb break="no"/>lamy</persName>, and waited on her to inquire after <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, 
                    <lb/>who I perceived, by your letter, was a person in whose 
                    <lb/>fate either yourself, or some of your friends, were particu-
                    <lb break="no"/>larly interested. When I discovered who this <persName>Mrs. Bel-
                      <lb break="no"/>lamy</persName> was, I will confess I was surprised how you could be 
                    <lb/>any way engaged in an inquiry after a woman who had re-
                    <lb break="no"/>sided in her family; as she is the mother of the celebrated 
                    <lb/><persName>Mrs. O’Donnell</persName>, who has alienated the affection of the 
                    <lb/>(otherwise) worthy <persName>Lord Linden</persName>, from his amiable Lady 
                    <lb/>and her lovely children; and this <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> was al-
                    <lb break="no"/>ways supposed to be the vile agent who instigated the 
                    <lb/>daughter to attempt to ensnare, and whose counsel after-
                    <lb break="no"/>wards assisted her to bind fast, the fetters which hold his 
                    <lb/>Lordship in his unworthy bondage.—However, I presum-
                    <lb break="no"/>ed you had some very good reason for desiring me to be 
                    <lb/>particular in my enquiry, and I set in earnest about it.—
                    <lb/>The old gentlewoman received me with politeness, <choice><sic>regreted</sic><core>regret-
                      <lb break="no"/>ted</core></choice> that it was not in her power to give me the desired in-
                    <lb break="no"/>formation where <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> was to be found; said 
                    <lb/>she had been much deceived in her; that she had brought 
                    <lb/>her from <placeName>England</placeName> with her, to superintend the education 
                    <lb/>of her grand daughter; but that very soon after their ar-
                    <lb break="no"/>rival in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, she, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, made acquaintance with 
                    <lb/>some low people in the <choice><orig>neighbourhood</orig><reg>neighborhood</reg></choice>; and one day 
                    <lb/>when she was out, she had taken her trunk and gone off, 
                    <lb/>without leaving any message whatever; and that she ima-
                    <lb break="no"/>gined she was gone with a kind of sailor-looking man, who 
                    <lb/>used frequently to come after her.—While she was speak-
                    <lb break="no"/>ing, a servant came in to bring a note; of whom she en-
                    <lb break="no"/>quired whether any of the people below had heard or seen 
                    <lb/>any thing of <persName>Darnley</persName>, since she went away? The young 
                    <lb/>woman replied, that <persName>Mrs. O’Donnell’s</persName> <persName>John</persName> had said, he 
                    <lb/>saw her a few days since go into a house in an alley at the 
                    <lb/>lower end of the town.—‘It is no great matter where she 
                    <lb/><choice><sic>is,</sic><corr>is,’</corr></choice> replied <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, <choice><sic>for</sic><corr>‘for</corr></choice> what is she good <choice><sic>for.</sic><corr>for?</corr></choice> She 
                    <lb/>imposed on me, when she applied for employment, by tell-
                    <lb break="no"/>ing an artful tale of her husband’s misfortunes; said neces-
                    <lb break="no"/>sity had obliged her to separate herself from him; but I 
                    <lb/>rather think, from what I have since heard, that he had 
                    <lb/>good reasons for separating from her.’ After this intelli-
                    <lb break="no"/>gence, my good Sir, you may be sure I felt no very great 
                    <lb/>curiosity to hear any more about your fair adventurer; but 
                    <lb/>as you had expressed so ardent a desire for information, I 
                    <lb/>took down the name of the alley where the woman said she 
                    <lb/>had been seen, and went immediately there; inquired at 
                    <lb/>every house where I thought it was likely I might find her, 
                    <lb/>describing her person according to the description given in 
                    <lb/>your letter; I had almost given up all hope, when going 
                    <lb/>into a house that stood a little more back than the rest, 
                    <lb/>I found she was known to the mistress of it, and had lived 
                    <lb/>there several weeks.

                UPON my first inquiry, I found <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> had left 
                <lb/>this woman, impressed with no higher an opinion of her 
                <lb/>prudence or virtue, than <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> was.—She seemed 
                <lb/>eager to give me all the information in her power; and as 
                <lb/>I thought, giving her permission to talk as fast and as long 
                <lb/>as she pleased, would be gratifying at once her favorite 
                <lb/>propensity, and enable me to give you a more succinct ac-
                <lb break="no"/>count of the person for whom you were so much interest-
                <lb break="no"/>ed, I remained silent, and only endeavored to connect the 
                <lb/>story, and free it from its superfluities. I learnt that about 
                <lb/>two months since, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> had come to this house and 
                <lb/>taken a lodging—She did not go by the name of <persName>Darnley</persName>, 
                <lb/>but <persName>Beetham</persName>; and the woman discovered her real name by 
                <lb/>a pocket handkerchief she dropped one day in taking some 
                <lb/>linen from her trunk, on which <persName>Sarah Darnley</persName> was marked 
                <lb/>at full length. ‘I took up the handkerchief,’ said the 
                <lb/>woman, ‘and looking at her, said, I thought your name 
                <lb/>was <persName>Beetham</persName>?’ She <choice><orig>coloured</orig><reg>colored</reg></choice>, and said, ‘My name was 
                <lb/>once <persName>Darnley</persName>.’ ‘Then you are a married woman?’—
                <lb/>‘Yes,’ answered she, but she looked confused, so I thought 
                <lb/>I would question her further. ‘Where is your husband?’ 
                <lb/>says I.—She said she believed in <placeName>London</placeName>. —‘And what is 
                <lb/>he?’ ‘He was a merchant.’—‘And how came you to 
                <lb/>be separated from him?’ She shut up her trunk, Sir, 
                <lb/>and, taking the handkerchief out of my hand, tore off the 
                <lb/>corner and put it into the fire; yes, Sir, she put it into the 
                <lb/>fire, and told me that she did not know by what right I

                <lb/>good as turned me out of the room.—Now, Sir, this argu-
                <lb break="no"/>fied no good.—I thought so too; but not to weary you 
                <lb/>with her jargon, I found that this delicate <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>had been visited by a man several times in the course of a 
                <lb/>week; that three or four times she had gone out and stayed 
                <lb/>until between ten and eleven o’clock. At last, her land-
                <lb break="no"/>lady having remonstrated with her a little mildly upon 
                <lb/>keeping such late hours, she told her that she would not 
                <lb/>long be a trouble to her, for she had been seeking a situa-
                <lb break="no"/>tion in a family, and had, she thought, met with one to her 
                <lb/>satisfaction; that about a week afterwards she went away, 
                <lb/>leaving her trunk as security to the woman of the house, 
                <lb/>for she had never paid for the apartment she occupied; 
                <lb/>that having been absent nearly a fortnight, she returned one 
                <lb/>night, requesting to be again received, but at the same time
                <cb/>
                <lb/>said she had brought home no money; that she had only 
                <lb/>the clothes she had on, and what was in the woman’s pos-
                <lb break="no"/>session; and that she had walked twelve miles that day; 
                <lb/>but the apartment being let to another, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>went away; and a day or two after she was seen at a 
                <lb/><choice><orig>neighbouring</orig><reg>neighboring</reg></choice> house, where the woman said she sent her 
                <lb/>clothes after her.—I went to this house, but could get no 
                <lb/>further information, only that she had been there, and was 
                <lb/>gone they knew not whither. But it was the universal a-
                <lb break="no"/>greement of all, that she was a woman of light character; 
                <lb/>and the last person I inquired of, said she had been entirely 
                <lb/>supported by a very genteel old gentleman, and she sup-
                <lb break="no"/>posed was gone into better lodgings of his providing.

                So you perceive, my good Sir, that <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> is not 
                <lb/>destitute of new friends; and her having changed her name 
                <lb/>is an evident proof that she wishes to conceal herself from 
                <lb/>her old ones. I wish it had been my good fortune to pro-
                <lb break="no"/>cure any more satisfactory intelligence, but I could trace 
                <lb/>her no further. I hope she has neither father, brother, or 
                <lb/>husband to be dishonored by her conduct. If I can be of 
                <lb/>any further use, any directions you may be pleased to send, 
                <lb/>shall be punctually followed by
              </p>

              <p>
                CAN you conceive for a moment what my agony of 
                <lb/>mind was, during the perusal of this letter, to see how my 
                <lb/>poor friend has been misrepresented; for, until I have man-
                <lb break="no"/>ifest evidence of it, I can never believe her lost to honor. 
                <lb/>She may have been betrayed, (the very supposition is tor-
                <lb break="no"/>ture to my <choice><orig>heart, for</orig><reg>heart</reg></choice>) if she has, she is lost to me and to the 
                <lb/>world forever; she will conceal herself from the knowl-
                <lb break="no"/>edge of every one, whom she had known before.—But it 
                <lb/>is not in nature for her to become a voluntary slave to vice. 
                <lb/>Indeed, it is plain to me, throughout every part of this let-
                <lb break="no"/>ter, that she has been persecuted and ill used; perhaps 
                <lb/>driven to extreme distress; want of bread or clothing 
                <lb/>would not tempt her into the paths of shame; but when in 
                <lb/>distress, should a man of sense, delicacy, of polished man-
                <lb break="no"/>ners, and insinuating address, relieve her, and then sue for 
                <lb/>her <choice><orig>favour</orig><reg>favors</reg></choice>—I cannot answer for her heart; and when 
                <lb/>the heart is enthusiastically impressed with grateful sensa-
                <lb break="no"/>tions, how soon will assiduous tenderness, from an engaging 
                <lb/>object, make it vibrate with a warmer sensation, and then, 
                <lb/>what are our best resolutions? I speak not as a woman 
                <lb/>only, but as a child of frailty; for such are all the sons 
                <lb/>and daughters of <persName>Adam</persName>. In such a situation, I would not 
                <lb/>answer for the steadiness even of my virtuous <persName>Sarah</persName>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Did I require any thing to convince me that she is not 
                <lb/>the depraved being they have represented her, the sincerity 
                <lb/>of her replies to the woman who interrogated her about her 
                <lb/>handkerchief, would be a sufficient proof, that she retain-
                <lb break="no"/>ed her native singleness of heart; which, to me, was ever 
                <lb/>the most interesting trait in her character. Before she 
                <lb/>could become abandoned, she would have learnt to dissem-
                <lb break="no"/>ble. What can I do? How shall I find her? I have re-
                <lb break="no"/>quested <persName>Mr. Lewis</persName> to write to his friend once more; in 
                <lb/>the mean time, I am determined, however eccentric you 
                <lb/>may think the step, to write to the <persName>Marquis of <placeName>H—</placeName></persName>, and 
                <lb/><choice><orig>endeavour</orig><reg>endeavor</reg></choice> to interest him in her behalf; a man of his rank 
                <lb/>has great influence in such a city as <placeName>Dublin</placeName>; and if he has 
                <lb/>the smallest spark of honor, he will exert himself to re-
                <lb break="no"/>store to her friends, a woman whom his insulting overtures 
                <lb/>forced to seek shelter in poverty and shame, from the 
                <lb/>solicitations of vice, and the dread of ignominy. When I 
                <lb/>have put this plan in execution, and waited a reasonable 
                <lb/>time for an answer, you shall hear again from

                    THE trouble I am about to give your Lordship, may 
                    <lb/>perhaps, be deemed an impertinent intrusion; and an apol-
                    <lb break="no"/>ogizing introduction, might by some, be thought indispensa-
                    <lb break="no"/>ble; but I trust your Lordship will admit the cause, when 
                    <lb/>I have explained it, of itself, a sufficient excuse for the lib-
                    <lb break="no"/>erty I take, without my offering any other.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have, my Lord, for many years, been in habits of the 
                    <lb/>strictest intimacy with a lady of the name of <persName>Darnley</persName>, 
                    <lb/>who, from a concurrence of unfortunate circumstances, was 
                    <lb/>an intimate in <persName>Mrs. Bellamy’s</persName> family during last winter, 
                    <lb/>where, I have been informed, your Lordship became ac-
                    <lb break="no"/>quainted with her, and judging of her character and prin-
                    <lb break="no"/>ciples, from the character of those, in whose society you 
                    <lb/>found her, (a fair criterion, I own, in general, but in her 
                    <lb/>case, very erroneous,) you made her a proposal, which, 
                    <lb/>though it evinced much love, breathed very little respect. 
                    <lb/>The receipt of that letter, drove <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> <choice><orig>precipitaably</orig><reg>precipi-
                      <lb break="no"/>tately</reg></choice> from <persName>Mrs. Bellamy’s</persName>, and forced a virtuous woman 
                    <lb/>on a prejudiced and misjudging world, without money, 
                    <lb/>without even a single friend being near, to whom she 
                    <lb/>could apply for relief. These particulars I had from her 
                    <lb/>own hand, since when, I have heard nothing from her; 
                    <lb/>anxious, unhappy, I employed a person in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, to make 
                    <lb/>enquiries concerning her, and have had the misfortune to 
                    <lb/>hear, that her character has been vilely <seg xml:id="a092" corresp="#n092">traduced</seg><note xml:id="n092" corresp="#a092"><term style="font-style: italic">Traduced</term>: slandered.</note> by those, 
                    <lb/>who, shamed by her unshaken virtue, endeavour to bring 
                    <lb/>her to a level with themselves. As I presume your Lord-
                    <lb break="no"/>ship was uncommonly pleased with the person of <persName>Mrs. 
                      <lb/>Darnley</persName>, I am led to imagine, when she left the house of 
                    <lb/>that dishonour to her sex, <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, you would natu-
                    <lb break="no"/>rally make some enquiries concerning her, and perhaps may 
                    <lb/>have some knowledge of her present situation. If you 
                    <lb/>have, my lord, have the goodness to inform her, that her 
                    <lb/>silence has almost broken my heart, and beg her to make 
                    <lb/>use of a letter of credit, which she will find at <persName>Mr. John 
                      <cb/>
                      <lb/>Gallaghan’s</persName>, the banker, to discharge any debts she may 
                    <lb/>have contracted, and return home to the bosom of friend-
                    <lb break="no"/>ship. If, indeed, you do not know where she is, will your 
                    <lb/>Lordship condescend to make use of the influence your 
                    <lb/>rank and fortune give you, and cause her to be sought for; 
                    <lb/>and if you will permit one of your people to inform me, of 
                    <lb/>the success of the enquiry, you will enhance the obliga-
                    <lb break="no"/>tion. Indeed, my Lord, you will never have cause to re-
                    <lb break="no"/>pent any interference in her behalf; or any assistance you 
                    <lb/>may give her; for in serving <persName>Sarah Darnley</persName>, you are serv-

                    I WAS honoured with your favour of <date when="1779-07-17">July 17th</date>, and 
                    <lb/>feel myself impelled to admire a friendship, so ardent and 
                    <lb/>sincere, as that which you profess to feel for the charming 
                    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>. You were right in your conjecture, that I 
                    <lb/>should make instant enquiry after the lovely fugitive, who 
                    <lb/>had taken such alarm at my letter, and fled, from what she 
                    <lb/>termed, my persecution. In that letter, I told her I would 
                    <lb/>see her in the evening; and at the hour I had appointed, I 
                    <lb/>repaired to <persName>Mrs. Bellamy’s</persName> house; judge of my surprise 
                    <lb/>at hearing she was gone, and had taken her trunks with 
                    <lb/>her; leaving no message, I enquired how she was convey-
                    <lb break="no"/>ed from the house; and learning that she went in a hack-
                    <lb break="no"/>ney coach, on my return home, I employed one of my <choice><orig>fellows</orig><reg>servants</reg></choice> 
                    <lb/>to enquire at the stands around, for the man who 
                    <lb/>had taken up a fare at such an hour, in such a street—by 
                    <lb/>this man I discovered where he had taken her, and went 
                    <lb/>in the evening of the following day, to the house where 
                    <lb/>he directed me; intending, if I could not prevail on your 
                    <lb/>fair friend to favour my suit, to insist upon being her bank-
                    <lb break="no"/>er, and serve her even against her will.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Upon my enquiry for the lady who lodged there, I 
                    <lb/>feared there was some mistake; for the woman of the 
                    <lb/>house shewed me into a little parlour, and said, she would 
                    <lb/>call <persName>Miss Beetham</persName>—however, I thought I might as well 
                    <lb/>stop, and see what kind of a being <persName>Miss Beetham</persName> was.—
                    <lb/>But my doubts were soon removed, for I heard her soft 
                    <lb/>voice say—“It must be a mistake, no gentleman can want 
                    <lb/>me.”—“It is no mistake, dear Madam,” said I, advanc-
                    <lb break="no"/>ing up two or three stairs, for from a room at the top of 
                    <lb/>them, the voice proceeded.—“It is no mistake; it is you I 
                    <lb/>am enquiring for, permit me to say the few words I have to 
                    <lb/>offer you.”—“You give yourself needless trouble,” said 
                    <lb/>she, coming out of the chamber, alarmed, I imagine, at 
                    <lb/>hearing my step ascending the stairs.—“I beg you will 
                    <lb/>leave me, you can offer nothing I can or will accept.” I took 
                    <lb/>her hand and led her down to the little parlour. She shut 
                    <lb/>the door, and seating herself opposite me, said, “My Lord, 
                    <lb/>I force myself to speak to you, that you may not, though 
                    <lb/>you have discovered the place of my retreat, entertain any 
                    <lb/>chimerical hopes, that I shall be wrought on, by the fear 
                    <lb/>of poverty, to yield to your insulting proposal; I am, it 
                    <lb/>is true, unfortunate, but I have ever maintained a con-
                    <lb break="no"/>science at peace with itself, and hope ever to do so; permit 
                    <lb/>me to tell you, it is cruel, unmanly conduct, thus to perse-
                    <lb break="no"/>cute a woman who has no protector—even your being here 
                    <lb/>this evening, if you were known, would ruin me in the 
                    <lb/>opinion of those with whom I reside, and to whom I must 
                    <lb/>look for a character when I can get employment: I must 
                    <lb/>insist on your not repeating your visits.”—I would have 
                    <lb/>argued, she was deaf; I offered her my purse, bills to any 
                    <lb/>amount, but she would touch neither. I endeavoured to 
                    <lb/>hold her in conversation, to obtain leave to visit her: but 
                    <lb/>she was as impenetrable as marble; and having, with the 
                    <lb/>most persuasive earnestness, entreated me to leave her in 
                    <lb/>peace, she darted out of the room, ran up stairs, and fast-
                    <lb break="no"/>ened the chamber door; nor would any thing I could say, 
                    <lb/>induce her to open it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Bless me,” said the officious landlady, bursting out of a 
                    <lb/>little back room, which seemed a kind of kitchen, “bless 
                    <lb/>me, what has put the lady in such a taking?” “I have 
                    <lb/>brought some unpleasant news, Madam,” said I, and think-
                    <lb break="no"/>ing it was as well to have a friend at court, I took two or 
                    <lb/>three guineas from my purse, and presenting them to the 
                    <lb/>woman, who eyed them with inexpressible pleasure, I con-
                    <lb break="no"/>tinued, “<persName>Miss Beetham</persName> is rather unfortunate in some res-
                    <lb break="no"/>pects, and will require much of your attention to keep up 
                    <lb/>her spirits. I am glad to see she is in the house of a per-
                    <lb break="no"/>son so interested for her, as you appear to be. Pray take 
                    <lb/>these as a mark of my good will, and be assured, you shall 
                    <lb/>be no loser by any attention you pay her. I hope she 
                    <lb/>will not think of removing from you, if she should, I will 
                    <lb/>thank you to let me know.” I then gave her an address, 
                    <lb/>with a feigned name, in order to her sending me intelli-
                    <lb break="no"/>gence of the motions of her fair lodger.

                THE next day, happening to meet <persName>Mrs. Bel-
                  <lb break="no"/>lamy</persName> at <persName>Mrs. O’Donnell’s</persName> lodgings, whither I 
                <lb/>went with my friend Lord Linden; the conver-
                <lb break="no"/>sation turned on your charming friend; when to 
                <lb/>my great surprise, the old woman asserted, that, 
                <lb/>however far <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> might carry her affecta-
                <lb break="no"/>tion (as she chose to term it) she was certain in the 
                <lb/>end, my offers would be accepted. And you 
                <lb/>may believe me, Madam, had it not been for 
                <lb/>their insinuations, and her being a resident in the 
                <lb/>house of a woman, of more than doubtful char-
                <lb break="no"/>acter, I should never have presumed to have of-
                <cb/>
                <lb break="no"/>fended <persName>Mrs. Darnley’s</persName> delicacy, by a tender of 
                <lb/>my services upon terms which I might have been 
                <lb/>certain any woman of honour would reject with 
                <lb/>scorn. They laughed at me, for having been so 
                <lb/>easily baffled, and imposed on by her assumed 
                <lb/>virtue; told me she had been guilty of some 
                <lb/>lapses which were the cause of her separation 
                <lb/>from her husband; and so effectually argued me 
                <lb/>out of the respect I began to experience for her, 
                <lb/>that I was resolved not to have my schemes foil-
                <lb break="no"/>ed by an artful baggage, who, in all probability, 
                <lb/>would laugh in her sleeve, at finding me so easily 
                <lb/>imposed on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having received intelligence from my talka-
                <lb break="no"/>tive friend, the landlady, that <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, <choice><orig>or,</orig><reg>or</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>as she called herself, <persName>Miss Beetham</persName>, had adver-
                <lb break="no"/>tised herself for a situation to wait on a lady, or 
                <lb/>to take care of and instruct one or more young 
                <lb/>children. I therefore dispatched an old trusty 
                <lb/>servant, (who no more than myself would have 
                <lb/>engaged in the pursuit of a virtuous woman) I 
                <lb/>told him it was her whim to be treated with res-
                <lb break="no"/>pect, and be considered as a pattern of purity, and 
                <lb/>that the very semblance of virtue was so charm-
                <lb break="no"/>ing, that I would have her indulged. He was 
                <lb/>to represent himself as the steward of a lady who 
                <lb/>lived a small distance from the city, who wanted 
                <lb/>a companion; that he should engage her at a 
                <lb/>liberal salary, and take her to a seat of mine in 
                <lb/>the environs of <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, where I meant to engage 
                <lb/>a quondam acquaintance of mine, to personate 
                <lb/>the lady, and thought time and concurring cir-
                <lb break="no"/>cumstances would smooth the way to settlement,
                <lb/>&amp;c.
              </p>
              <p>
                But this plan was not so easily put in execu-
                <lb break="no"/>tion as I imagined it would be. She would 
                <lb/>make no engagements without letters from the 
                <lb/>principal; so much time was spent in this ideal cor-
                <lb break="no"/>respondence, at length when all preliminaries were 
                <lb/>settled, the pretended lady chose to take a jaunt 
                <lb/>into the country, with a <seg xml:id="a094" corresp="#n094"><term style="font-style: italic">chere amie</term></seg><note xml:id="n094" corresp="#a094"><term style="font-style: italic">Chere amie</term>: “dear (female) friend,” in French.</note> of hers, and 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> was obliged to be sent to the care 
                <lb/>of the house-keeper, until her intended lady should 
                <lb/>return.—At length she did return, and I resolv-
                <lb break="no"/>ed to accompany her home, to shew my charm-
                <lb break="no"/>er, as early as possible, that I was upon a foot-
                <lb break="no"/>ing of easy familiarity in the family; but no 
                <lb/>sooner had she entered the parlour, and cast her 
                <lb/>eyes towards us, than uttering an exclamation 
                <lb/>of surprise, she sunk on the floor in a state of in-
                <lb break="no"/>animation. I flew towards her, raised and sup-
                <lb break="no"/>ported her in my arms until some female attend-
                <lb break="no"/>ants, obeying the summons of the bell, conveyed 
                <lb/>her out of the room. When, turning to my 
                <lb/>companion, I beheld her pale, and every mark 
                <lb/>of astonishment on her countenance. “Is this 
                <lb/><choice><orig>your</orig><reg>you</reg></choice> <persName>Miss Beetham</persName>?” said she, ironically. “Yes
                <lb/>—did you ever see her before?” “Oh yes! I 
                <lb/>fancy I know her better than your lordship does
                <lb/>—I do not imagine you will find much difficul-
                <lb break="no"/>ty in persuading her to accept your terms with-
                <lb break="no"/>out any interposition of mine.” “Was it sur-
                <lb break="no"/>prise at the sight of you, do you imagine, occa-
                <lb break="no"/>sioned her to faint?” “No—I rather think it 
                <lb/>was joy at the sight of your lordship; for accord-
                <lb break="no"/>ing to the plan you have pursued, she must have 
                <lb/>supposed she had lost you. I fancy her fit will 
                <lb/>not prove dangerous—she will tell you to-mor-
                <lb break="no"/>row, how violent, yet how delightful her emo-
                <lb break="no"/>tions were.” This was delivered in such a tone 
                <lb/>of ridicule, that I began to think I must appear 
                <lb/>very contemptible to suffer myself thus to be 
                <lb/>played upon. I retired to my chamber, in a 
                <lb/>very ill humour, resolving to converse with <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName> in the morning, and if she would not 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>comply with my proposals, to make her a present, 
                <lb/>and take a final leave of her. Still in the midst 
                <lb/>of my vexation, there was something flattering 
                <lb/>in idea that she might feel some emotions in my 
                <lb/>favour; and that being taken by surprise, she 
                <lb/>was thrown off her guard, and her sensibility, at 
                <lb/>my unexpected appearance, overcame her cau-
                <lb break="no"/>tion. I was kept waking until a late hour, by 
                <lb/>various reflections, and extraordinary conjectures, 
                <lb/>and slept the next morning longer than usual. 
                <lb/>When I descended to the breakfast room, I found 
                <lb/>my travelling companion waiting for me. “Go,” 
                <lb/>said I to the footman, “tell <persName>Miss Beetham</persName> that 
                <lb/>breakfast waits, and if she is able to leave her a-
                <lb break="no"/>partment, we shall be glad of her company to 
                <lb/>make our tea.”—“Your Lordship may save 
                <lb/>yourself the trouble,” said the lady, “<persName>Miss Beet-
                  <lb break="no"/>ham</persName> has taken herself off. I sent to enquire af-
                <lb break="no"/>ter her, when I came down, but behold, the <emph style="font­-style: italic">deli-
                  <lb break="no"/>cate, fainting, tender creature</emph> is no where to be 
                <lb/>found.”—“Gone?” said I, “impossible!” I or-
                <lb break="no"/>dered the house, the <choice><sic>gronnds</sic><corr>grounds</corr></choice>, the servants’ offices, 
                <lb/>and every adjoining place to be searched, but in 
                <lb/>vain. A small trunk, with a few changes of lin-
                <lb break="no"/>en in it, (the only baggage she brought with her) 
                <lb/>was left behind in her chamber.

              </p>
              <p>
                YOU may easily imagine, Madam, that this 
                <lb/>intelligence gave me great uneasiness; I was sen-
                <lb break="no"/>sible it could only be a wish to avoid me that 
                <lb/>prompted her flight, and that whatever might be 
                <lb/>the motive for her conduct, she had now carried 
                <lb/>it too far to be any longer attributed to affec-
                <lb break="no"/>tation. I returned to <placeName>Dublin</placeName> and employed the 
                <lb/>same man who had negociated the business of a 
                <lb/>place, &amp;c. as related, to watch round the house 
                <lb/>where she had lodged, and if she returned thither, 
                <lb/>to offer her money, of which I was sure she must 
                <lb/>be in great need; and a letter of apology for my 
                <lb/>former conduct, entreating her to pardon a fault 
                <lb/>I had been led to commit, by the malignity of 
                <lb/>her enemies. I professed my full conviction of 
                <lb/>the purity of her heart, and requested she would 
                <lb/>permit me to nominate some proper person to 
                <lb/>protect and conduct her in safety to her friends 
                <lb/>in <placeName>England</placeName>. But he returned in the evening, 
                <lb/>informing me, she had not been there. I could 
                <lb/>not, upon reflecting on the circumstances of the 
                <lb/>preceeding evening, help suspecting that <persName>Mrs. Ry-
                  <lb break="no"/>an</persName>, the woman whom I mentioned to have been 
                <lb/>with me, had deceived me, as well as the detest-
                <lb break="no"/>ed <persName>Bellamy</persName>; and that she knew more of <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName> than she chose to declare. According-
                <lb break="no"/>ly the next day, I repaired to her house, in order 
                <lb/>to make more minute enquiries. I found her 
                <lb/>surrounded by several gentlemen, but my impa-
                <lb break="no"/>tience would brook no delay. I however consid-
                <lb break="no"/>ered it would be doing the object of my enquiry 
                <lb/>an injury to enquire after her, of such a woman; 
                <lb/>for I must not pretend to disguise from you, 
                <lb/>that this <persName>Mrs. Ryan</persName> was a <seg xml:id="a096" corresp="#n096">Cyprian votary,</seg><note xml:id="n096" corresp="#a096"><term style="font-style: italic">Cyprian votary</term>: a prostitute.</note> 
                <lb/>who some years since, took a trip with me 
                <lb/>from <placeName>London</placeName> to the continent; and from 
                <lb/>thence came with me to <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, where we part-
                <lb break="no"/>ed by mutual consent; though I had never en-
                <lb break="no"/>tirely foreborn to visit her. I therefore enquired 
                <lb/>for her by her assumed name. “What, have 
                <lb/>you not found your little runaway yet?” said 
                <lb/>she, “it seems to be my lot to fall in with the 
                <lb/>admirers of the eccentric <persName>Sarah</persName>.” “<persName>Sarah</persName>! 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName> who?” exclaimed a young naval officer, 
                <lb/>with a look of alarmed tenderness. “Oh! what
                <lb/>—here is another lover I suppose,” said she, 
                <lb/>laughing; “who would have thought the home-
                <lb break="no"/>ly <persName>Sarah</persName> would ever have become so formida-
                <lb break="no"/>ble.”—“But what was her other name?” said 
                <lb/>the young officer with increased vehemence. 
                <lb/>“Oh, I dare not call her by her right name,” 
                <lb/>said she, scornfully, “my <persName>Lord H—</persName> will nev-
                <lb break="no"/>er forgive me if I do; but to satisfy you, and 
                <lb/>that you may be convinced, whether it is your 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName> or not, I will shew you her picture, which 
                <lb/>I stole one evening in sport from a lover of mine, 
                <lb/>and he never after demanded it, to let me see 
                <lb/>how indifferent he was to the original.” The 
                <lb/>agitation of the stranger was extreme, while she 
                <lb/>was gone up stairs to get the picture. “Here,” 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>said she, presenting it, “it is a great likeness, I 
                <lb/>assure you, though I think her handsomer now 
                <lb/>than when it was taken.”—He took it—he gazed 
                <lb/>on it—he clasped it in his hands, and elevating 
                <lb/>them towards heaven with a look of indescriba-
                <lb break="no"/>ble anguish—exclaimed, “Oh God! Oh God! 
                <lb/>my sister.—Where is she? how came she here? 
                <lb/>lead me to her.—Yet—no! no! tell me she is 
                <lb/>no longer in existence, for I would rather hear 
                <lb/>she was dead, than find her what every thing I 
                <lb/>hear and see leads me to fear she is. Dear, un-
                <lb break="no"/>happy <persName>Sarah</persName>, well might you neglect to answer 
                <lb/>my letters. God of heaven, can it be my sister! 
                <lb/>my sister!” All this was uttered with a vehemence 
                <lb/>and rapidity that totally precluded interruption; 
                <lb/>but at the end, his heart’s anguish overflowed at 
                <lb/>his eyes, and throwing himself on the sopha, 
                <lb/>he hid his face and gave a free course to his feel-
                <lb break="no"/>ings. <persName>Mrs Ryan</persName>, when she perceived what she had 
                <lb/>done, was frightened. “Lord bless me,” said she, 
                <lb/>“who would have thought <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> was 
                <lb/>your sister?” “Peace, woman,” said I, “leave me 
                <lb/>a few minutes with the gentleman; your unfeel-
                <lb break="no"/>ing thoughtlessness has pierced him to the heart.” 
                <lb/>She withdrew to another apartment with her 
                <lb/>other visitors, and I seated myself by the broth-
                <lb break="no"/>er of <persName>Mrs Darnley</persName>; silently waiting a pause in `
                <lb/>his grief to speak and administer consolation.—
                <lb/>At length he raised his head, and looking at me, 
                <lb/>said, “Do you know my wretched sister? but why 
                <lb/>do I ask? perhaps it is to you she owes—” 
                <lb/>His countenance reddened, and I perceived what 
                <lb/>past in his mind.—“Do not form Sir,” said I 
                <lb/>gravely, “hasty and erroneous conclusions. I 
                <lb/>have had the honor of being in <persName>Mrs. Darnley’s</persName> 
                <lb/>company, and do not hesitate to profess myself 
                <lb/>one of her warmest admirers; I believe her to be 
                <lb/>unfortunate, but I would pledge my life that she 
                <lb/>is innocent.”—I then related to him all that had 
                <lb/>taken place after my first seeing her at <persName>O’Don-
                  <lb break="no"/>nel’s</persName>, not in the least sparing myself, though I 
                <lb/>pleaded the characters of the women with whom 
                <lb/>I found her as some extenuation of my offence; 
                <lb/>he was willing to allow it, but was lost in conjec-
                <lb break="no"/>ture bow it was possible she could be thrown a-
                <lb break="no"/>mong such people. We questioned Ryan as to 
                <lb/>what she knew about <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, and could 
                <lb/>get nothing from her, but that she once lived in 
                <lb/>the same neighborhood where she resided. Mr. 
                <lb/>— had heard of his sister’s marriage, but had 
                <lb/>not received a line from her, nor any intelligence 
                <lb/>concerning her, for eighteen months past; how-
                <lb break="no"/>ever, he resolved to go to <persName>Mrs. Bellamy’s</persName> and 
                <lb/>insist on learning from her, what had induced 
                <lb/>his sister to accompany her to <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. We 
                <lb/>went immediately, but found to our great mor-
                <lb break="no"/>tification, that she was gone on a jaunt of pleas-
                <lb break="no"/>ure with her daughter, and would not return un-
                <lb break="no"/>der a fortnight or three weeks.

                DISAPPOINTED in the point we aimed 
                <lb/>at, that of forcing <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> to tell <persName>Mr. 
                  <lb/>Lewis</persName> all she knew concerning his sister; I found 
                <lb/>it almost impossible to bring his perturbed spirits 
                <lb/>to any tolerable degree of composure. I accom-
                <lb break="no"/>panied him to the place where she had lodged; 
                <lb/>but there the woman gave such a strange account 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>of her, as threw him almost into a paroxysm of 
                <lb/>phrenzy. He did not expect to remain in <placeName>Dub-
                  <lb break="no"/>lin</placeName> more than a week or ten days, the ship he be-
                <lb break="no"/>longed to, coming to <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, being entirely unex-
                <lb break="no"/>pected. I found by his conversation, that <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName> is only a nominal sister, he having been 
                <lb/>adopted by her father. I was led to suspect from 
                <lb/>that circumstance, that it might be more than 
                <lb/>fraternal affection which made him so anxious; 
                <lb/>but he soon dissatisfied that doubt, by an assu-
                <lb break="no"/>rance to the contrary, in such terms as necessari-
                <lb break="no"/>ly enforced belief. He wrote to her husband a 
                <lb/>letter, of such bitter reproach, demanding his sis-
                <lb break="no"/>ter at his hands in terms so peremptory, that if 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName> is a man of the least spirit, whenever 
                <lb/>they meet, a duel will most probably ensue. He 
                <lb/>inserted an advertisement in the papers, couched 
                <lb/>in such terms, as if it fell into her hands, and she 
                <lb/>wished to return to her friends, she could not but 
                <lb/>understand it; yet so delicate as not to wound 
                <lb/>her feelings by making her situation a topic for 
                <lb/>public animadversion. But before either an an-
                <lb break="no"/>swer could arrive to the letter, or any good ef-
                <lb break="no"/>fect arise from the latter expedient, his ship 
                <lb/>was ordered away—and he departed, earnestly 
                <lb/>conjuring me to continue my endeavors to find 
                <lb/>and succour <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, and have her convey-
                <lb break="no"/>ed in safety to <placeName>England</placeName>, where he expected to be 
                <lb/>in the course of a few months. On taking leave, 
                <lb/>he requested me to inquire for his letter and op-
                <lb break="no"/>en it, whenever it should arrive. I did so—it 
                <lb/>contained these lines:—

                    <lb break="no"/>ing voluntarily separated herself from me; after 
                    <lb/>having by her love of dissipation and thoughtless 
                    <lb/>extravagance, combined with other circumstances, 
                    <lb/>reduced me to bankruptcy; and having been ab-
                    <lb break="no"/>sent now five months without writing to me 
                    <lb/>above twice, which was in the early period of 
                    <lb/>her absence, I cannot inform you of any thing

                    <lb/>pay any debts of her contracting. I have heard

                    <lb/>left <placeName>England</placeName>, that she has left her protection; has 
                    <lb/>given herself up to folly and infamy; and from 
                    <lb/>this hour, I renounce any connection whatever

              <p>
                My soul rose indignant as I perused this un-
                <lb break="no"/>feeling, unmanly scrawl, for it deserves not the 
                <lb/>name of a letter; and I sincerely rejoiced that 
                <lb/><persName>Mr. Lewis</persName> was not here to read it. The conduct 
                <lb/>of <persName>Bellamy</persName> is most detestable; I was impatient 
                <lb/>for her return, that I might reproach her as she 
                <lb/>deserved, and oblige her to write to <persName>Darnley</persName>, and 
                <lb/>unsay all she had asserted; nay, despicable as the 
                <lb/>wretch appears to me, I had resolved to write to 
                <lb/>him myself, and defend his aspersed wife to the 
                <lb/>utmost of my power; but upon reflection, I fear-
                <lb break="no"/>ed, as I had not discovered her retreat, and could 
                <lb/>not account for her conduct in thus keeping her-
                <lb break="no"/>self concealed, I might, by interference, when 
                <lb/>I could not fully vindicate, injure rather than 
                <lb/>serve her. In this suspense, I was obliged to 
                <lb/>leave <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, to which place I did not return 
                <lb/>until a few days before the receipt of your letter. 
                <lb/>The earnest solicitude you expressed, again awak-
                <lb break="no"/>ened my desire of finding your friend; for I had 
                <lb/>before, in some degree, quieted my mind, by the 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>flattering supposition that she might be returned 
                <lb/>to <placeName>England</placeName>. I now again saw <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, 
                <lb/>and in a tone of authority, demanded if she had 
                <lb/>heard any thing of the woman she had so ill 
                <lb/>treated. “Oh yes,” said she, with a smile of 
                <lb/>contempt, “I can direct your lordship to her lodg-
                <lb break="no"/>ings, where the <emph style="font­-style: italic">delicate, virtuous</emph> lady is supported by 
                <lb/><persName>O’Donnell</persName>.” “Impossible,” said I. “Not at all im-
                <lb break="no"/>possible,” said <persName>Mrs. O’Donnell</persName>, who was present, “I 
                <lb/>believe she has been under his protection above two 
                <lb/>months.” I waited to hear no more, but taking 
                <lb/>the direction, hurried to the place where they 
                <lb/>said she resided. As I was entering the door, for 
                <lb/>it was late in the evening, a man jostled me, and 
                <lb/>turning quick, seized my arm and exclaimed, 
                <lb/>“Have I found you then!” I endeavoured to 
                <lb/>shake off his hold, but in so doing, his hat fell off, 
                <lb/>the lamp at entrance shone faintly into the pas-
                <lb break="no"/>sage, and I discovered <persName>Frederick Lewis</persName>. “Heav-
                <lb break="no"/>ens <persName>Mr. Lewis</persName>,” said I, “how came you here?” 
                <lb/>“I came to rescue a sister from infamy,” said 
                <lb/>he, then slacking his hold, he continued in a tone 
                <lb/>of sorrow—“But that you, my lord, after all 
                <lb/>your pretended friendship, after all your affected 
                <lb/>search for the poor fallen frail one, should prove 
                <lb/>her seducer.”—“Do not irritate me, <persName>Lewis</persName>,” 
                <lb/>said I, “that I came here in search of <persName>Mrs. Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName>, I will allow, but I call Heaven to witness”—
                <lb/>“Your asseverations, and base subterfuges, will 
                <lb/>no longer avail you,” said he in an elevated tone. 
                <lb/>The bustle in the passage, which did not immedi-
                <lb break="no"/>ately belong to the house, but led to the door, 
                <lb/>attracted attention, and it was opened by a wo-
                <lb break="no"/>man, who inquired what was the matter.—“Does 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah Darnley</persName> lodge here,” said <persName>Lewis</persName>; the wo-
                <lb break="no"/>man replied in the negative. “You have a fe-
                <lb break="no"/>male lodger,” said he, “and I wish to see her. 
                <lb/>“She admits no male visitors,” replied the wo-
                <lb break="no"/>man, “especially at this time of night.” “I 
                <lb/>must see her,” said he, with vehemence, “I have 
                <lb/>reasons for supposing her my sister; is not her 
                <lb/>name <persName>Sarah</persName>.” A shriek from the parlour with-
                <lb break="no"/>in announced that we were overheard; and in 
                <lb/>an instant, a female rushed by the mistress of the 
                <lb/>house, and throwing herself into the arms of <persName>Mr. 
                  <lb/>Lewis</persName>, fainted—It was <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> herself.—
                <lb/>She is now safe in the protection of her brother, 
                <lb/>and I presume you will embrace her nearly as 
                <lb/>soon as you receive this letter. She will inform 
                <lb/>you of every particular during her period of con-
                <lb break="no"/>cealment. The recital will cost you many tears; 
                <lb/>it melted me almost to a childish weakness.—
                <lb/>Adieu, Madam, I hope I have convinced you, 
                <lb/>that however blameable my conduct was, at first, 
                <lb/>in regard to your amiable friend, I endeavoured 
                <lb/>to repair my errors the moment I discovered they 
                <lb/>were such. Be pleased to accept my wishes for 
                <lb/>your happiness, and that of the woman so deserv-
                <lb break="no"/>edly esteemed by you, and allow me to hope for 
                <lb/>a place in both your memories; for to be num-
                <lb break="no"/>bered among the friends of <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, will 
                <lb/>ever be deemed an honour,

                I WILL suppose you to have read the Marquis’s let-
                <lb break="no"/>ter, and am sure I need not expatiate on the delight it 
                <lb/>conveyed to my mind. I became impatient for the arri-
                <lb break="no"/>val of <persName>Sarah</persName>; moments appeared hours, hours days, and 
                <lb/>days weeks; think then by this mode of computation 
                <lb/>what an immense period a whole fortnight must have 
                <lb/>appeared; for so long it was before I embraced my friend; 
                <lb/>and when she did come, to pale, so changed was she, that 
                <lb/>my heart bled as I contemplated her depressed counte-
                <lb break="no"/>nance. <persName>Frederick Lewis</persName> could only deliver her in safety 
                <lb/>to me, and set off the next morning to join his ship which 
                <lb/>had arrived at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>. When he left <placeName>Dublin</placeName> as men-
                <lb break="no"/>tioned by the Marquis, in a state of suspence concerning 
                <lb/>his sister; the anxiety of his mind, joined to a cold which 
                <lb/>he took about that time, brought on a fever; and he ob-
                <lb break="no"/>tained leave to return in a pilot boat which passed them 
                <lb/>the second day after they were out; but on his reaching 
                <lb/>land, his disorder became so violent as to confine him to 
                <lb/>his bed for a very considerable period; and left him so 
                <lb/>weak that it was much longer before he was enabled to re-
                <lb break="no"/>new his enquiries, and he had only discovered the place of 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah’s</persName> residence the day previous to his encountering 
                <lb/><persName>Lord H</persName>. He had in the course of his enquiries, heard so 
                <lb/>many things to her disadvantage, that even his faith in 
                <lb/>her virtue began to be staggered, and resolved to watch 
                <lb/>and ascertain who visited her, and by what means she was 
                <lb/>supported. Resolved, should he find her involved in 
                <lb/>shame and guilt, to write to her, give her the means of re-
                <lb break="no"/>turning to <placeName>England</placeName>, but to see her no more. He had plac-
                <lb break="no"/>ed himself in the long passage for this purpose but a few 
                <lb/>minutes, when lord H. entered, and he immediately con-
                <lb break="no"/>cluded him to have been the original seducer, and present 
                <lb/>supporter of his sister; notwithstanding all his pretended 
                <lb/>anxiety. Indeed, he said it had often, during his illness 
                <lb/>occurred to him, that the Marquis knew where she was, 
                <lb/>and concealed her, pretending she had left him only to 
                <lb/>blind <persName>Ryan</persName>, who considered her (it was plain) as an object 
                <lb/>of envy and jealousy. You know how this rencounter 
                <lb/>terminated. When <persName>Frederick</persName> found his sister perfectly in-
                <lb break="no"/>nocent, which was evinced by her pale countenance, ex-
                <lb break="no"/>hausted frame, and plain coarse habiliments, he exe-
                <lb break="no"/>crated the wretches who had so inhumanly persecuted 
                <lb/>her. He conducted her to another lodging, and thought 
                <lb/>of nothing but hastening her departure from <placeName>Ireland</placeName>; but 
                <lb/>before they had proceeded a day’s journey, he perceived 
                <lb/>it would be impossible to proceed in her present weak 
                <lb/>state. He stopped at a pleasant village, and having pro-
                <lb break="no"/>cured medical advice; having satisfied himself that noth-
                <lb break="no"/>ing but rest and peace were necessary to restore her; he 
                <lb/>wrote to the Admiralty to lengthen his time of leave, and 
                <lb/>quietly awaited for her strength to recruit. This occa-
                <lb break="no"/>sioned the delay which was to me so intolerable; for as 
                <lb/>they knew I had heard from the <persName>Marquis of <placeName>H—</placeName></persName>. of her 
                <lb/>safety, and whose protection she was under, they did not 
                <lb/>think it necessary to write, daily hoping to recommence 
                <lb/>their journey.

              <p>
                When <persName>Frederick</persName> took leave of his sister, he recom-
                <lb break="no"/>mended her not to take any steps to see her husband; 
                <lb/>he even thought she ought to oppose any advancement 
                <lb/>made by <persName>Darnley</persName> for a re-union; and I was of his opin-
                <lb break="no"/>ion. I will give you her answer. “I will own to you, 
                <lb/>my brother, that I never found any great portion of fe-
                <lb break="no"/>licity in my union with <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>; yet when I enter-
                <lb break="no"/>ed into marriage with him, I resolved, to the utmost of 
                <lb/>my abilities, to perform the duties incumbent on the sa-
                <lb break="no"/>cred obligation; my separation from him, was enforced 
                <lb/>by necessity; but had I known the misery of a state of 
                <lb/>separation, how forlorn, how desolate, how totally un-
                <lb break="no"/>protected a married woman is, when separated from her 
                <lb/>husband; how every one thinks he may insult her with 
                <lb/>impunity, and no one will take the trouble to defend her, 
                <lb/>but rather unite in aspersing and depressing her, even to 
                <lb/>the very earth; I would have never thrown myself in-
                <lb break="no"/>to so deplorable a situation. I will make no overtures 
                <lb/>towards a re-union; but should he solicit me to pardon 
                <lb/>his unkind neglect, and again share his fate, I shall cer-
                <lb break="no"/>tainly do it; I apprehend that I have by no means, been 
                <lb/>free from blame in my conduct towards him; I have 
                <lb/>been thoughtless in my expenditures. I perhaps have 
                <lb/>not fulfilled his expectations in respect to the tenderness 
                <lb/>of a wife. Alas! it is hard to teach the countenance or 
                <lb/>tongue to express what the heart does not feel. Do not 
                <lb/>be angry, <persName>Frederick</persName>, but I am convinced I shall never a-
                <lb break="no"/>gain appear respectable in the eyes of the world, until I 
                <lb/>am again under my husband’s protection.” <persName>Frederick</persName> 
                <lb/>would have combatted her opinion, but it was useless; 
                <lb/>all he could obtain, was a promise that she would no far-
                <lb break="no"/>ther seek him, than to acquaint him with her return, 
                <lb/>and then act as circumstances should direct. She has ac-
                <lb break="no"/>cordingly written a note, which to-morrow I shall dis-
                <lb break="no"/>patch to him. I hardly know whether to censure or ap-
                <lb break="no"/>plaud her resolution. She has suffered greatly both with 
                <lb/>him, and from him; perhaps, should any means of their 
                <lb/>living in some degree of ease and plenty offer, they may 
                <lb/>taste more happiness than has yet fallen to their portion. 
                <lb/>He, so long abridged of the comforts of domestic regular-
                <lb break="no"/>ity, and the pleasures which must arise from the society 
                <lb/>of a good humoured rational companion, will, I should 
                <lb/>think, hear of her return with delight, and invite her 
                <lb/>home with the ardour of a lover, long separated from 
                <lb/>his mistress. My dear <persName>Sarah</persName> has kept a regular journal, 
                <lb/>if so it can be called, of every occurrence which took 
                <lb/>place, from her quitting <persName>Mrs. Bellamy’s</persName> to the time of 
                <lb/>her meeting <persName>Frederick</persName>. It was addressed to me, with a 
                <lb/>design should any event have put a period to her ex-
                <lb break="no"/>istence, it might have been transmitted to me, and have 
                <lb/>justified her to her father should he ever return; or her 
                <lb/>brother, whom at that time she had but little hope of 
                <lb/>seeing again so soon. I have obtained leave to send it to 
                <lb/>you; it will explain many circumstances which at present 
                <lb/>appear problematical, and will, I think, greatly interest 
                <lb/>your feelings. When you have perused, you will be so 
                <lb/>good as to return it by the next post, as every thing 
                <lb/>which bears the impression of <persName>Sarah’s</persName> hand is valuable 
                <lb/>to me. When any new circumstances occur, I will inform 
                <lb/>you.

                <lb/>brave companions, has seen them snatched from him by

                <lb break="no"/>tile indeed, but inhabited only by the shaggy natives of

                I have wandered by the glimmering twilight in the 
                <lb/>fields which skirt this vast city.—I listened to the distant 
                <lb/>hum of rattling coaches, bells and mingled sounds of 
                <lb/>human voices: I leaned pensively on an old gate which 
                <lb/>opened from the field to the great road. A couple passed 
                <lb/>me; the woman bore a bundle of faggots on her head, 
                <lb/>the man bore a heavier load upon his shoulders, they led 
                <lb/>a little half naked boy between them. “You are tired, 
                <lb/><persName>Bett</persName>,” said he in a voice which though rough, spoke kind 
                <lb/>solicitude. “No, <persName>Thomas</persName>,” she replied, “not very tired; 
                <lb/>but poor little <persName>Jack</persName> is I believe. But come <persName>Jack</persName>, trip 
                <lb/>along while daddy carries home the gentleman’s trunk; 
                <lb/>you and I will go make a fire and get his supper.”—
                <lb/>They were now so far I could hear no more: but the 
                <lb/>words they had uttered, rested on my mind, and servile 
                <lb/>as their situation in life appeared to be, and menial as 
                <lb/>was evidently their occupation, yet the solacing accents 
                <lb/>of kindness in which they addressed each other, the ten-
                <lb break="no"/>der care each appeared to feel for the other’s ease and 
                <lb/>comfort, made my forlorn and desolate situation appear 
                <lb/>by contrast so dreadful, that had not an impetuous gush 
                <lb/>of tears relieved me, I must have fallen into a fit.

                The night air was cold—I had tarried until darkness 
                <lb/>had rendered every object of one sombre hue.—My gar-
                <lb break="no"/>ments are damp: my limbs chilled.—I look round my 
                <lb/>apartment—no friendly flame blazes on the hearth—
                <lb/>no face looks a smile of welcome; the poor taper, the pur-
                <lb break="no"/>chase of a farthing, sheds a pale ray of light, and shews 
                <lb/>my hard uncurtained bed—Hard! Oh let me not com-

                <lb/>into being—whose breath could make them vanish, like 
                <lb/>the mist before the rising sun, nor leave a trace of what 
                <lb/>they were behind; no creature is so mean but thou re-
                <lb break="no"/>gardest it; no being is so depressed, but thou canst raise 
                <lb/>it.—Father! have I a father? yes, one who rides upon 
                <lb/>the tempest, is borne on the wings of thousands and ten 
                <lb/>thousands of cherubims—but for my earthly father!—

                My dear friendly <persName>Ann</persName>, I have several times attempted 
                <lb/>to inform you of what has befallen me since I quitted 
                <lb/>that bad woman, <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>; but my mind has been 
                <lb/>so distracted, my heart so lacerated, and my spirits so de-
                <lb break="no"/>pressed, that when I have taken up my pen to write, it 
                <lb/>has wandered off into some wild <seg xml:id="a101" corresp="#n101">apostrophe</seg><note xml:id="n101" corresp="#a101"><term style="font-style: italic">Apostrophe</term>: an address to a person or thing.</note> or uncon-
                <lb break="no"/>nected remark. And even now, when I set down deter-
                <lb break="no"/>mined to relate things as they happened, I ask myself, 
                <lb/>why should I?—Of what use will it be to grieve you by 
                <lb/>a relation of sufferings you cannot alleviate? I am re-
                <lb break="no"/>solved then, I will write; but until I am either dead or 
                <lb/>some favourable change takes place in my affairs, you 
                <lb/>will not peruse the writing. I write, because it is my 
                <lb/>pleasantest occupation; I forbear to forward it, because 
                <lb/>it contains nothing, that can give pleasure to any one 
                <lb/>by whom I am held in the least estimation.

                I told you my mind wanders—it does so—and I was 
                <lb/>obliged just now to lie down my pen—My thoughts and 
                <lb/>wishes ever tend to dear England—Oh! why, why did 
                <lb/>I so precipitately leave it!

                  IN a closet belonging to the room where I slept, and 
                  <lb/>indeed, where I pass almost all my solitary hours, I found 
                  <lb/>an odd volume of <persName>Smollett’s</persName> works; it was the first volume 
                  <lb/>of <seg xml:id="a103" corresp="#n103"><persName>Roderic Random</persName>;</seg><note xml:id="n103" corresp="#a103"><term style="font-style: italic">Roderic Random</term>: the title character of <persName>Tobias Smollet’s</persName> <date when="1748">1748</date> picaresque novel <bibl style="font­-style: italic">The Adventures of Roderick Random</bibl>. The scene described occurs in Chapter 11.</note> I sat down in the hope that it might 
                  <lb/>occupy my mind, and draw me for a few moments from 
                  <lb/>myself. I opened it at the part which gave an account of 
                  <lb/>young <persName>Roderic</persName>, and <persName>Strap</persName>, his companion setting forward on 
                  <lb/>their journey to <placeName>London</placeName>; when I came to the pleasure they 
                  <lb/>felt on being admitted into a waggon, which was going that 
                  <lb/>road, I felt so forcibly that not even that humble mode 
                  <lb/>of travelling was open to me, that I was, perhaps, sepa-
                  <lb break="no"/>rated from every being who was in the smallest degree 
                  <lb/>interested in my fate, that I dropped the book and burst 
                  <lb/>into an agony of tears. Yes, my <persName>Ann</persName>, I am so sensible 
                  <lb/>of my unprotected, forlorn situation, that I wished with 
                  <lb/>all my soul, that I had never been provoked, by any 
                  <cb/>
                  <lb/>treatment whatever, to quit my husband; his name was 
                  <lb/>at least a protection from insult; to him I had a right to 
                  <lb/>look for support, and scanty and grudgingly as that sup-
                  <lb break="no"/>port might be given, it still was no obligation to receive 
                  <lb/>it from him. The house which shelters him is mine, I 
                  <lb/>have purchased the right to share it at the price of all 
                  <lb/>earthly happiness. I have never forfeited it, and if ev-
                  <lb break="no"/>er I am again united to him, I will never again be <choice><orig>seperated</orig><reg>sep-

                  <lb break="no"/>qually so now, and have added to my other miseries, the 
                  <lb/>knowledge that my good name is tarnished, my reputa-
                  <lb break="no"/>tion aspersed by the blackest calumny, and I am supposed 
                  <lb/>to affect a virtue and delicacy which I no longer in reality 
                  <lb/>possess.

              <p>
                The <persName>Marquis of <placeName>H—</placeName></persName> discovered my retreat very 
                <lb/>shortly after I had escaped from that house of infamy 
                <lb/>where he first saw me. I found from his conversa-
                <lb break="no"/>tion, that he thought me not entitled to the respect 
                <lb/>which unsullied virtue never fails to extort, even from 
                <lb/>the most depraved. I hope I need not assure you that I 
                <lb/>resisted every allurement, though pressed on me in the 
                <lb/>most fascinating forms.—Independence—attendants—e-
                <lb break="no"/>quipage—but the equivalent to be relinquished, was 
                <lb/>self approbation—A treasure too invaluable to be barter-
                <lb break="no"/>ed for such worthless trifles.—Independence—yes! 
                <lb/>Power Eternal, give me Independence, but let it be in-
                <lb break="no"/>dependence of mind—let me persevere in doing right<choice><orig>—</orig><reg>;</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>let my actions be ever such as may secure thy favour 
                <lb/>and the applause of my own conscience; and then, 
                <lb/>though the unfeeling world may oppress, may break my 
                <lb/>tortured heart, I shall have that comfort left, which 
                <lb/>never will forsake me, but will support my fluttering spir-
                <lb break="no"/>it even through the gloomy vale of death.
              </p>
              <p>
                I do not like my landlady, she is impertinently inquis-
                <lb break="no"/>itive and curious. I do not go by my own name, I 
                <lb/>took another in the hope it would elude any enquiry, 
                <lb/>which my persecutor might think proper to make 
                <lb/>after me, and though it answered not the designed pur-
                <lb break="no"/>pose, I still continued my assumed one. The woman 
                <lb/>came abruptly into my room one morning, while I was 
                <lb/>looking over my little wardrobe, she examined every 
                <lb/>thing on which she could lay hold, made some imperti-
                <lb break="no"/>nent remarks on the fineness of the linen, and the richness 
                <lb/>of that lace, with which you, my dear <persName><choice><orig>Ann</orig><reg>Anne</reg></choice></persName>, presented 
                <lb/>me on your return from France, soon after my marriage, 
                <lb/>and which was the only article of the kind, which I re-
                <lb break="no"/>tained on <persName>Darnley’s</persName> bankruptcy. She at length laid 
                <lb/>her hand on a pocket handkerchief, which was marked 
                <lb/>with my name at full length. I have an utter aversion 
                <lb/>to duplicity of every kind, and when she asked me 
                <lb/>whose name that was? I replied, it was mine.—She im-
                <lb break="no"/>mediately replied hastily, “Oh! then you are a married 
                <lb/>woman.” And in a few moments inundated me with 
                <lb/>so many questions, answering some of them herself, ac-
                <lb break="no"/>cording to her own vague conclusions, and interlarding 
                <lb/>all with so many old adages, and wise sayings, about pru-
                <lb break="no"/>dence and virtue, withal intimating that she guessed I 
                <lb/>was a frail one, when I came there in such a hurry, and 
                <lb/>that when a woman has once ventured ancle deep, she 
                <lb/>may as well go on, for it was impossible to go back. I 
                <lb/>stood petrified, at her effrontery: mistaking my silent as-
                <lb break="no"/>tonishment for attention, she thus proceeded: “I sup-
                <lb break="no"/>pose you thought now that we should have known nothing a-
                <lb break="no"/>bout you, but you had not been here three days, before 
                <lb/>I heard the whole story—how you have been living 
                <lb/>with <persName>Madam Bellamy</persName>, and every body knows what she 
                <lb/>is—but for my part, I wonder you treated lord what 
                <lb/>d’ye call’em there so rudely—I dare say he would be 
                <lb/>very generous to you, and there is such a thing as <seg xml:id="a105" corresp="#n105">overstand-
                  <lb break="no"/>ing one’s market.”</seg><note xml:id="n105" corresp="#a105"><term style="font-style: italic">Overstanding one’s market</term>: to miss one’s opportunity (OED).</note>—I had risen from my chair, while 
                <lb/>she was speaking, and holding the handkerchief which I 
                <lb/>had taken from her in my hand, was so absorbed in 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>vexatious thoughts, that I tore it in small strips, and 
                <lb/>threw it, strip at a time into the fire, without being 
                <lb/>sensible of what I was about. “Well, you may burn 
                <lb/>your handkerchief,” said she, “if you please, but that ar-
                <lb break="no"/>gufies nothing. I remember the name—<persName>Darnley</persName>, that 
                <lb/>was it, so Mrs. or Miss, or Madam, or my <persName>lady Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName>”—“Quit my room, woman,” said I, almost choak-
                <lb break="no"/>ed with indignation, and not giving her time to finish 
                <lb/>her taunting speech. “Quit the room I desire, I am bu-
                <lb break="no"/>sy, I do not want company of any kind. Think what 
                <lb/>you please, draw what conclusions you please, I only beg 
                <lb/>not to be tormented by hearing them.” She made use 
                <lb/>of a few more exasperating words and then went mut-
                <lb break="no"/>tering down stairs.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am in hopes to get into employment here; I have 
                <lb/>made application to be received into some family as a 
                <lb/>companion to an elderly lady, or to superintend the in-
                <lb break="no"/>struction of children, and yesterday a person came to 
                <lb/>speak to me on the subject. It was a middle aged man, 
                <lb/>who said he had been employed by a lady in the coun-
                <lb break="no"/>try, to enquire for a well educated woman, with the hab-
                <lb break="no"/>its and manners of a gentlewoman, who would bear con-
                <lb break="no"/>finement, and be content to see but little company: For 
                <lb/>such a one she wanted as a companion, to read to her, 
                <lb/>sometimes to act as an <seg xml:id="a106" corresp="#n106">amanuensis,</seg><note xml:id="n106" corresp="#a106"><term style="font-style: italic">Amanuensis</term>: someone taking dictation.</note> as she is a person 
                <lb/>fond of literary pursuits. I did not feel inclined to en-
                <lb break="no"/>ter into any engagement with this man, but told him 
                <lb/>such a situation would exactly suit me, but I must hear 
                <lb/>from the lady herself; he told me he would write and 
                <lb/>that in a day or two I might expect an answer; and in 
                <lb/>truth my dear <persName>Ann</persName>, it is high time, for I have changed 
                <lb/>my last crown; what I am to do if I am much longer 
                <lb/>without the means of earning bread, heaven only knows. 
                <lb/>I wrote to <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> for the money she owed me, 
                <lb/>she had the effrontery to tell the messenger, that she 
                <lb/>knew nothing about me.—I know the selfish disposition 
                <lb/>of my inquisitive landlady too well, to indulge the hope 
                <lb/>that I shall be allowed shelter under her roof many 
                <lb/>days, after she makes the discovery that I have no mon-
                <lb break="no"/>ey to pay my lodging.
              </p>
              <p>
                The negotiator, whose name is <persName>Manton</persName>, was with me 
                <lb/>again about an hour since; he tells me the lady is not at 
                <lb/>home at present, she is gone on a short visit, but the 
                <lb/>letter is sent after her, in the mean time, he seemed so 
                <lb/>sure of my obtaining the place, that he offered to ad-
                <lb break="no"/>vance me any money I might want. But this I have re-
                <lb break="no"/>fused; I will suffer any necessity, rather than accept an 
                <lb/>obligation, I may never have the power to return—es-
                <lb break="no"/>pecially from a man.
              </p>
              <p>
                My dear good <persName>Ann</persName>, you will hardly believe what 
                <lb/>bad hearts there are in this world. I have subjected 
                <lb/>myself to an insult, which has given my sensibility so 
                <lb/>keen a wound, that were I to live an hundred years, if 
                <lb/>memory retained a trace of any past transaction, the re-
                <lb break="no"/>membrance of it will ever give me an indescribable 
                <lb/>pang.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pressed by necessity, and having no idea that human 
                <lb/>nature could be so depraved, I went in the close of the 
                <lb/>evening to the house of the infamous <persName>Bellamy</persName>. As I was 
                <lb/>known to the servant who opened the door, I found no 
                <lb/>difficulty in gaining admittance, but when, on being in-
                <lb break="no"/>formed she was at home, I made an attempt to ascend the 
                <lb/>stairs, the girl told me, she dared not let me into her 
                <lb/>mistress’s apartment, but if I would wait, she would car-
                <lb break="no"/>ry up any message.—“Only tell her I am here, and 
                <lb/>wish to speak to her,” said I. “It will be to little pur-
                <lb break="no"/>pose,” she replied, “but I will go.” Determined to see 
                <lb/>her if possible, I followed the girl up the stairs.

                THE servant opened the door. I perceived there 
                <lb/>were several persons in the room “Ma’am,” said the 
                <lb/>girl, “<persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> is below, and wishes to speak to 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>you.” “Who,” cried <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, “<persName>Darnley</persName>, did you 
                <lb/>say? What does she want here?” “I came,” said I, ad-
                <lb break="no"/>vancing into the room, “to request the payment of the 
                <lb/>money.”— “Money, woman! what money? I believe 
                <lb/>if there is any account to settle, it is vastly in my favour; 
                <lb/>did I not pay your journey from <placeName>London</placeName>? and did you 
                <lb/>not board in my family three months?” “Was not that 
                <lb/>your engagement?” I asked. “Don’t talk to me of en-
                <lb break="no"/>gagements, creature, you have broken every engagement 
                <lb/>you ever entered into. Did you not agree to remain with 
                <lb/>me, and take the care of my grand-daughter, and yet 
                <lb/>you took yourself off without assigning any reason, with-
                <lb break="no"/>out giving me even the smallest notice; putting me to the 
                <lb/>expense and inconvenience of hiring a French maid for 
                <lb/>the child. But I know all your tricks; your going out 
                <lb/>when I was not at home; your private assignations with 
                <lb/>the men. Yes, and I know who you went away with too; the 
                <lb/>Marquis did not so suddenly leave <persName>Mrs. O’Donnel’s</persName> that 
                <lb/>evening, and be absent two or three hours, for nothing, 
                <lb/>after he had engaged himself to sup and spend the evening 
                <lb/>there with <persName>Lord Linden</persName>. Your husband shall know all 
                <lb/>your fine pranks, I promise you. I have written to him; 
                <lb/>poor man! I dare say he has thought you a pattern of 
                <lb/>virtue, but I have undeceived him.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “And what have you dared to write?” said I, with 
                <lb/>some degree of spirit. “Pretty innocent,” said she, taunt-
                <lb break="no"/>ingly, “you have done nothing I suppose, to make a hus-
                <lb break="no"/>band <seg xml:id="a108" corresp="#n108"><emph style="font­-style: italic">horn mad</emph>;</seg><note xml:id="n108" corresp="#a108"><term style="font-style: italic">Horn-mad</term>: enraged, often with the specific connotation of having been the victim of adultery (OED).</note>—you are all purity, but indeed I wonder 
                <lb/>I demean myself by talking to you; go, pray walk off 
                <lb/>and let me hear no more of you.”
              </p>
              <p>
                <persName>Ann</persName>, I do protest to you, conscious as I was of not de-
                <lb break="no"/>serving this treatment, of never having swerved from 
                <lb/>my duty as a wife, my innocence would not support me 
                <lb/>under this torrent of abuse; I felt my heart sicken with-
                <lb break="no"/>in me, and I caught by the back of a chair to avoid 
                <lb/>sinking, (for she had insolently kept me standing, while 
                <lb/>she spoke to me.) Poor little <persName>Caroline</persName>, who was in the 
                <lb/>room, had been sidling towards me from the moment of 
                <lb/>my entering; she now took hold of my hand and said, 
                <lb/>“Sit down, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>.” “Sit down, indeed,” said the 
                <lb/>unfeeling <persName>Bellamy</persName>. “I say, walk down; come away 
                <lb/><persName>Caroline</persName>, I won’t have you speak to the impudent—,” 
                <lb/>and she called me a name, my beloved <persName>Ann</persName>, which my 
                <lb/>pen refuses to trace upon my paper. Fluttered as my 
                <lb/>spirits were, and—and—why should I conceal it? I had 
                <lb/>not broken my fast that day.—Awakened resentment, 
                <lb/>struggling sensibility, joined to want of food, overcame 
                <lb/>me and I fell.—My insensibility was not of long con-
                <lb break="no"/>tinuance; the first thing I was sensible of, was, that <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>O’Donnell</persName> was supporting my head against her bosom, 
                <lb/>and <persName>Caroline’s</persName> little hand was bathing my temples with 
                <lb/><seg xml:id="a109" corresp="#n109"><placeName>Hungary</placeName> water.</seg><note xml:id="n109" corresp="#a109"><term style="font-style: italic"><placeName>Hungary</placeName> water</term>: a distilled wine infused with rosemary, used as a restorative (OED).</note> “Poor thing,” said one of the visitors, in 
                <lb/>a voice so gentle and tender, that though I knew she 
                <lb/>was a woman of despicable character, I felt grateful; and 
                <lb/>if looks could speak, I thanked her for the soothing ac-
                <lb break="no"/>cent. I endeavoured to rise. “Lean on me,” said the 
                <lb/>same person, offering her arm. “Give her a glass of 
                <lb/>wine,” said <persName>Mrs. O’Donnell</persName>. <persName>Caroline</persName> flew to the side-
                <lb break="no"/>board. “Let the wine alone,’ said <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, “she 
                <lb/>has had enough already, I can see that, she is drunk, it is 
                <lb/>not the first time I have seen her in these kind of fits—”
                <lb/>come,” continued she, addressing me, “you had better 
                <lb/>make the best of your way home; bed is the fittest 
                <lb/>place for you; if you had been in your senses you 
                <lb/>would never have presumed to come here <seg xml:id="a110" corresp="#n110">dunning</seg><note xml:id="n110" corresp="#a110"><term style="font-style: italic">Dunning</term>: attempting to collect debts.</note> me

                <lb/>without staggering, let her go about her business; for 
                <lb/>my part, I wonder how she got here.”—I would have 
                <lb/>spoken, I would have given some answer to this opprobri-
                <lb break="no"/>ous language, but the tears flowed almost to suffocation. 
                <lb/>I raised my clasped hands to Heaven, and my sobs en-
                <cb/>
                <lb break="no"/>creased with such violence, that I feared I should have 
                <lb/>an hysteric fit. “Take her away, take her away,” vocif-
                <lb break="no"/>erated the old woman, “she has got quite in her tragedy 
                <lb/>airs.”—I found that to speak was impossible; so leaning 
                <lb/>on the arm of <persName>Molly</persName>, I bowed my head in resignation to 
                <lb/>my fate, and left the room—The servant had some feel-
                <lb break="no"/>ings of humanity, she took me into the back parlour, 
                <lb/>and procured me from the kitchen, a cup of tea and a 
                <lb/>slice of bread and butter. I took them, and felt refresh-
                <lb break="no"/>ed. While I was drinking the tea, <persName>Caroline</persName> came in, “I 
                <lb/>am sorry,” said she, “Grandma has been so cross to you; 
                <lb/>Mamma sends you this, and says if you will call on her 
                <lb/>to-morrow, she will do something for you.”—The dona-
                <lb break="no"/>tion sent, was half a guinea.—<persName>Ann</persName>, my soul revolted, but 
                <lb/>necessity was strong, and reflecting that more than four 
                <lb/>times that sum was owing me, I took the money, and 
                <lb/>having in some measure recovered myself, returned to 
                <lb/>my lodging.
              </p>
              <p>
                Is it possible, that woman can have been so base, as 
                <lb/>wilfully to calumniate a being who never injured her? 
                <lb/>can she have written to Darnley such an infamous false-
                <lb break="no"/>hood? and will he believe her? I know not how she can 
                <lb/>have learnt how to direct to him, unless she has noticed 
                <lb/>his address on my letters at any time whilst I was with 
                <lb/>her. You too, my dear <persName>Ann</persName>, will hear the shocking tale, 
                <lb/>I have no doubt; but you will not believe it—I know 
                <lb/>you will not. Oh! my poor heart, how it aches. I will 
                <lb/>try to rest—nay, forlorn and desolate as I am, I shall rest, 
                <lb/>for I can lay my throbbing head on the pillow and say, 
                <lb/>“I am persecuted, but I am innocent,” at least of the hu-
                <lb break="no"/>miliating, degrading crimes of which my enemy accuses 
                <lb/>me; and for the errors to which human nature is prone, 
                <lb/>I can say in perfect confidence, “Father! Father of All! for-
                <lb break="no"/>give me, as from my inmost soul I forgive others.”—Yes, I 
                <lb/>am not so wretched as I might be, I can sleep in peace.

              <p>
                Several letters have passed between me and <persName>Mrs. Ryan</persName>, 
                <lb/>the lady with whom I am about to engage as companion. 
                <lb/>She tells me, she does not expect to be home these ten 
                <lb/>days yet, but I may go to her house in the country, and 
                <lb/>wait for her. This permission is very agreeable to me, 
                <lb/>as I am here very much distressed. You are certain that 
                <lb/>I have never been to <persName>Mrs. O’Donnell</persName> for assistance, and 
                <lb/>the half guinea she sent me is exhausted.—My terror of 
                <lb/>again encountering the vulgar abuse of that savage <persName>Bella-
                  <lb break="no"/>my</persName>, is so great, that I think I could suffer almost the ex-
                <lb break="no"/>treme of hunger, rather than solicit her again, for what 
                <lb/>is indubitably my right. I shall be obliged to leave part 
                <lb/>of my scanty wardrobe with the woman with whom I 
                <lb/>have lodged; I have no other means of satisfying her 
                <lb/>demands: she has set her mind upon the lace you gave 
                <lb/>me, but that she shall not have.

              <p>
                I have settled every thing with this harpy of a land-
                <lb break="no"/>lady, and my stock of apparel is now reduced very low; 
                <lb/>she has promised, if I send her the money I owe, within a 
                <lb/>month, that I shall have my clothes again. To-morrow, 
                <lb/>I set out for the country; <persName>Mr. Manton</persName> will convey me 
                <lb/>in a post chaise. I shall not feel right until I see the la-
                <lb break="no"/>dy of the mansion. I catch myself frequently painting 
                <lb/>in imagination, her person, her manners, her style of con-
                <lb break="no"/>versation, &amp;c. I have drawn twenty different pictures, 
                <lb/>and it is ten to one if either of them bears the smallest re-
                <lb break="no"/>semblance to the original.

                THE mansion where I now am, is more like the fam-
                <lb break="no"/>ily seat of an opulent nobleman, than the dwelling of a 
                <lb/>private gentlewoman. I inquired of the housekeeper, 
                <lb/>(who is the only servant except the housemaid and gar-
                <lb break="no"/>dener, who is at present at home,) if this house had been 
                <lb/>long the family mansion? She replied, that it was the 
                <lb/>seat of her lady’s father; that she was an only child, 
                <lb/>consequently an heiress. The park and grounds are de-
                <lb break="no"/>lightful, and kept in very excellent order. I understand 
                <lb/>that there is a fine library, but this was locked; however, I 
                <lb/>found a few novels and poems in one of the <choice><orig>bedchambers</orig><reg>bed cham-
                  <lb break="no"/>bers</reg></choice>, and flimsy as the materials which compose the gen-
                <lb break="no"/>erality of novels are, they have afforded me some hours 
                <lb/>amusement, and drawn me from myself; a comfort grate-
                <lb break="no"/>ful to the unhappy, by whatever means procured.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the turbulence, the mean and sordid scenes, and 
                <lb/>depraved companions with whom it has within these 
                <lb/>four last months been my lot to mix, the quiet and con-
                <lb break="no"/>veniences I here enjoy, seem a cordial to my depressed 
                <lb/>spirits. I can collect my thoughts; I can read, or work, 
                <lb/>for I found the housekeeper engaged in making up some 
                <lb/>very fine linen, which she said was for a gentleman in the 
                <lb/>neighborhood, and I have taken some of it to help 
                <lb/>her; employment is always necessary to my comfort, and 
                <lb/>never more so than at present. Where the mind is pain-
                <lb break="no"/>fully occupied, the hands should never be a moment idle. 
                <lb/>If the imagination is active, and ardent, it naturally par-
                <lb break="no"/>takes in the occupation of the fingers, and fancy will wan-
                <lb break="no"/>der from our own selfish concerns to the work, from 
                <lb/>the work to those for whom we are executing it, paint-
                <lb break="no"/>ing as she goes, persons, places, and events, in which, 
                <lb/>though we are no wise connected, we find a kind of pleas-
                <lb break="no"/>ing amusement in depicting to ourselves.—I often wander 
                <lb/>for hours in the park and gardens, and I say within my-
                <lb break="no"/>self, these are scenes congenial to my soul; here is quiet, 
                <lb/>order, neatness; the eye glances round and still gleans 
                <lb/>in its wanderings, some charm, some soothing sensation 
                <lb/>which it conveys to the heart, to soften, cheer, and ele-
                <lb break="no"/>vate it. Yet believe me, dear <persName>Ann</persName>, I have never felt the 
                <lb/>most distant wish to possess such a house, such a park, or 
                <lb/>gardens; no! I am well assured, many are the vexations 
                <lb/>accompanying wealth; many the inconveniences to which 
                <lb/>the possessors must submit, as a tax for the luxuries they 
                <lb/>are permitted to enjoy; a decent competence best suits 
                <lb/>my disposition; a neat dwelling removed from the noise, 
                <lb/>hurry, and dissipation, of the gay, thoughtless and com-
                <lb break="no"/>mercial world; my income sufficient to supply all my 
                <lb/>comforts, and some few of the elegancies of life, with 
                <lb/>means to make those friends, whose talents or merit 
                <lb/>might render them dear to my heart, welcome to share my 
                <lb/>abode and table whenever it might suit their inclination; 
                <lb/>and just so near a capital town, as might enable me, by 
                <lb/>way of enhancing the sweets of retirement, sometimes to 
                <lb/>mingle in its amusements. Such a state would be the 
                <lb/>height of my ambition. I have not mentioned the pow-
                <lb break="no"/>er of assisting the poor, because they who with an hun-
                <lb break="no"/>dred pounds a year, cannot find the heart to give relief, 
                <lb/>would I am sure, find themselves equally reluctant, though 
                <lb/>their annual income should be five thousand.—Nor is it 
                <lb/>by money alone, their wants are to be alleviated; a wo-
                <lb break="no"/>man benevolently inclined, may, from the overplus of her 
                <lb/>family provisions, from the refuse of her wardrobe, make 
                <lb/>many a poor child comfortable; but where the one is 
                <lb/>permitted to be wasted by the improvident servants, and 
                <lb/>the other is thrown carelessly away, or is heedlessly des-
                <lb break="no"/>troyed, (when a few hours work might convert them in-
                <lb break="no"/>to respectable and useful garments,) even a large fortune 
                <lb/>will not allow of much liberality.

                You perceive, my <persNME>Ann</persNME>, by the style of my letter, that 
                <lb/>my spirits are greatly composed since I wrote last. To-
                <lb/>morrow <persName>Mrs. Ryan</persName> is expected home; I understand she 
                <lb/>brings company with her; two chambers are prepared; 
                <lb/>my apartment is a very neat chamber, with a large light 
                <lb/>closet, containing all the dressing apparatus; it joins the 
                <lb/>one that I understand is <persName>Mrs. Ryan’s</persName>; a small but very 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>convenient writing desk, containing paper, &amp;c. with a 
                <lb/>well assorted box of colours, crayons, drawing paper, and 
                <lb/>all the implements for drawing, were placed in it; but as 
                <lb/>my lady was not here to put me in possession of them, I 
                <lb/>have not presumed to use any of them, though the house-
                <lb/>keeper told me they were designed for me. If I should 
                <lb/>be so happy as to find this lady agreeable, and the sit-
                <lb break="no"/>uation such as I can remain in until my salary shall en-
                <lb break="no"/>able me to pay what debts I have contracted, and return 
                <lb/>to <placeName>England</placeName> with respectability, I shall esteem myself for-
                <lb break="no"/>tunate. It is late in the evening—before this time to-
                <lb/>morrow night I shall have seen this formidable woman. 
                <lb/>Yes, it is a truth, that I have thought on her so much, 
                <lb/>formed so many conjectures concerning her, that the very 
                <lb/>anticipation of the meeting, sets my heart a beating. The 
                <lb/>window at which I am writing, looks upon a beautiful 
                <lb/>pond, over which impending willows hang, darkening 
                <lb/>with their thick foliage the translucent element on the 
                <lb/>side on which they grow; the moon is nearly at the full, 
                <lb/>her bright rays peeping between the pendant umbrage, 
                <lb/>seems to sprinkle here and there large orient pearls, and 
                <lb/>now the freshening breeze wafting aside a ponderous 
                <lb/>bough, her whole face flashed upon the liquid mirror, a 
                <lb/>stream of burnished silver, scarce seen before it was gone. 
                <lb/>So it has been with my life; a shade hung over, even its 
                <lb/>earliest part; as I advanced, a few rare gems were scatter-
                <lb break="no"/>ed in my path, and now and then a sudden flash of 
                <lb/>pleasure enlivened my bosom; but ah! how scanty was 
                <lb/>the portion, hardly felt, hardly realized, before they van-
                <lb break="no"/>ished.—To-morrow—well, patience—a few hours <choice><orig>more</orig><reg>more,</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>and I shall feel easier.

                Wretched! unhappy! oh my dear <persName>Ann</persName>, I am surely 
                <lb/>the very game of fortune.—What a plot have I escaped.
                <lb/>—This Marquis with all his pretended generosity, is a 
                <lb/>mean designing wretch. But I am away, I am my own 
                <lb/>mistress—I have a home under the roof of an honest 
                <lb/>though very poor woman, and in a way to purchase 
                <lb/>the immediate necessaries of life—namely, food to sup-
                <lb break="no"/>port it. But let me be a little methodical.—You may 
                <lb/>one day see this, and I would not have my <persName>Ann</persName> think it 
                <lb/>was written by a maniac; you may one day see it—<choice><orig>yes</orig><reg>yes,</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>I hope you will soon see it, and if my aching head, and 
                <lb/>debilitated frame prognosticate aright, a very short period 
                <lb/>will put an end to my sufferings; my heart is broken—
                <lb/>my very soul is bowed to the grave—I have wept the 
                <lb/>fountains of my eyes dry, and now they burn and shoot, 
                <lb/>while my heart that lately swelled and struggled even 
                <lb/>to agony, seems like an icicle in my bosom, as torpid and 
                <lb/>as cold.
              </p>
              <p>
                The whole day in which I expected the return of <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>Ryan</persName>, was past in a state of anxiety which I have not 
                <lb/>power to describe. Every unusual noise I heard, alarm-
                <lb break="no"/>ed me, until I had wrought myself into such a state of 
                <lb/>trepidation, that the rustling of a leaf, or foot of the 
                <lb/>house-maid in the adjoining apartment, pursuing her u-
                <lb break="no"/>sual avocations, made me gasp for breath.—At length a-
                <lb break="no"/>bout an hour after sun set, the sound of carriages, 
                <lb/>and a confused mixture of voices, horses’ feet and 
                <lb/>running up and down stairs, convinced me the dread-
                <lb break="no"/>ed, yet wished for time was arrived. In about half an 
                <lb/>hour a footman came up with <persName>Mrs. Ryan’s</persName> compliments 
                <lb/>and would be glad if I would walk down. I followed 
                <lb/>trembling; he opened the door of the parlour; I entered, 
                <lb/>when the first object that met my eyes, was the <persName>Marquis 
                <lb/>of <placeName>H—</placeName></persName>, and on the sofa near him, <persName>Jessy Romain</persName>!—
                <lb/>Had I broken unexpected into a nest of vipers, I could 
                <lb/>not have been more appalled—I know not what I said, 
                <lb/>but I believe I gave a loud and terrified exclamation; 
                <lb/>my limbs refused their office; I caught at the door; but 
                <lb/>my sight forsook me, and I <seg xml:id="a113" corresp="#n113">fell.</seg><note xml:id="n113" corresp="#a113">[<hi rend="italic">To be continued</hi>.]</note>

                THE momentary suspension of my faculties, could 
                <lb/>hardly be called a swoon; the multitude of painful ideas 
                <lb/>which pressed <seg xml:id="a115" corresp="#n115">impetuously</seg><note xml:id="n115" corresp="#a115">Changed to “imperiously” for novel.</note> upon my brain, on seeing 
                <lb/>the woman who had been the bane of my domestic peace 
                <lb/>associated with the man who had presumed openly to 
                <lb/>make overtures derogatory to my honour, struck me 
                <lb/>with horror; I seemed petrified, I could neither see nor 
                <lb/>hear distinctly, and to have articulated a single syllable, 
                <lb/>would have been impossible, and I remained above half 
                <lb/>an hour a mere passive machine in the hands of the house-
                <lb/>keeper, and a young woman, who I afterwards found was 
                <lb/>waiting maid to the infamous <persName>Romaine</persName>, alias <persName>Ryan</persName>; 
                <lb/>when I had recovered sufficiently to speak,—“Tell me,” said 
                <lb/>I, “in whose house I am.”—“Do you not guess?” said 
                <lb/>the house-keeper, with a luring smile, impossible to des-
                <lb break="no"/>cribe, and shocking to behold.—“I fear I can,” I replied, 
                <lb/>“but why was I brought here?” “Nay,” she answered, 
                <lb/>laughing outright, in a most insolent manner: “as you 
                <lb/>came here voluntarily with my Lord’s old confidential 
                <lb/>valet, I should suppose you might guess that too, without 
                <lb/>making such a fuss.”—“La! Ma’am,” said the young 
                <lb/>woman, in an affecting lisping tone, “perhaps the lady 
                <lb/>feels a little jealous or so, at seeing my lady, who is very 
                <lb/>handsome for sarten, so familiar with the Marquis; 
                <lb/>but dearee me, Miss, they have been separated above six 
                <lb/>months; to be sure, my lady did take a <seg xml:id="a116" corresp="#n116"><emph style="font­-style: italic">tower</emph> to the <emph style="font­-style: italic">con-

                <lb/>had a few words,—” She was going on with dis-
                <lb break="no"/>gusting <choice><sic>familiarly</sic><corr>familiarity</corr></choice> and volubility;— when I interrupted 
                <lb/>her—“you are mistaken, as to the cause of my agitation; 
                <lb/>I was surprised—I am distressed—but you cannot com-
                <lb break="no"/>prehend why I should be either the one or the other.” 
                <lb/>“Oh, dearee me, I’m sure I don’t want to inquire into 
                <lb/>nobody’s secrets, you knows your own business best, as 
                <lb/>the saying is, <choice><orig>there nobody</orig><reg>there is nobody</reg></choice> knows where the shoe pinch-
                <lb break="no"/>es, so well as they that wears it.”— “Well, <persName>Mrs. Flimsey</persName>,” 
                <lb/>said the house-keeper, “will you go down and have 
                <lb/>some tea. <persName>Miss Beetham</persName> seems quite recovered, and if she 
                <lb/>wants any thing, she will ring, and <persName>Betty</persName>, the housemaid 
                <lb/>will answer her bell—shall I send you up some tea, 
                <lb/>Mem?” continued she, turning towards me with affec-
                <lb break="no"/>ted respect. “I shall not want any thing <choice><orig>to night</orig><reg>tonight</reg></choice>,” I 
                <lb/>replied. “I will go to bed, and endeavour to rest,”—I 
                <lb/>said this to be rid of their intrusive rudeness; but the 
                <lb/>moment I found myself alone, I began to reflect seriously 
                <lb/>on my perilous situation; I was neither romantic enough, 
                <lb/>or so much of a child as to imagine I could in a civilized 
                <lb/>country, be compelled to submit to treatment which 
                <lb/>would render me, in my own opinion, the most degraded 
                <lb/>and wretched of all beings; but I was well aware, should 
                <lb/>it be known that I had voluntarily resided at the seat of 
                <lb/>a young nobleman, remarkable for his gallantry, nearly a 
                <lb/>fortnight, my reputation would be inevitably ruined, and 
                <lb/>should I remain one night after I knew whose house it 
                <lb/>was, and that the master of it was at home, I should in a 
                <lb/>great degree deserve the obloquy which might be thrown 
                <lb/>upon me.
              </p>
              <p>
                To leave the house this very night, was then my first 
                <lb/>concern, but how? I was twelve miles from <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, and 
                <lb/>had not a sixpence in the world—yet go I must—it was 
                <lb/>night—I was a stranger to the road—Yet, should I re-
                <cb/>
                <lb break="no"/>main, something might happen to prevent my making 
                <lb/>good my retreat.—I had been carried to my apartment in 
                <lb/>such a state of weakness, that I was certain, the Marquis 
                <lb/>and his associate would not have the smallest suspicion of 
                <lb/>my leaving the house before morning; and the woman 
                <lb/>having left me with the avowed intention of going to 
                <lb/>bed immediately, would give that information, should 
                <lb/>any enquiry be made concerning me. I therefore deter-
                <lb break="no"/>mined to leave the place immediately; and for that pur-
                <lb break="no"/>pose, was preparing to change my clothes, which being 
                <lb/>white muslin, were by no means suited to the making a 
                <lb/>pedestrian journey, when I discovered that my closet 
                <lb/>in which was my trunk containing every habiliment I 
                <lb/>possessed in the world, was locked, nor could I find the 
                <lb/>key any where; I was afraid to ring for the maid, lest 
                <lb/>something might occur to prevent my putting my design 
                <lb/>into execution. So quitting the apartment, locking the 
                <lb/>door, and taking the key with me, and with only a shawl 
                <lb/>thrown over my shoulders, I went softly down the back 
                <lb/>stairs; unbarred a door which opened into a retired part 
                <lb/>of the garden; I passed unobserved through it into the 
                <lb/>park; and from thence, without being interrogated, 
                <lb/>though several of the servants passed me, I reached the 
                <lb/>great road—I had enough of the fears inherent in my 
                <lb/>sex to feel extremely disagreeable at finding myself on 
                <lb/>the public road, leading to, and almost in the vicinity of 
                <lb/>a populous city, at ten o’clock at night. The sound of 
                <lb/>approaching boisterous travellers terrified me exceeding-
                <lb break="no"/>ly, and I turned out of the road, crossing a <seg xml:id="a117" corresp="#n117">style which 
                  <lb/>led to a little coppice;</seg><note xml:id="n117" corresp="#a117"><term style="font-style: italic">Style</term>: a set of steps used to get over an animal fence; <term style="font-style: italic">coppice</term>: a small thicket.</note> in which, by the light of the 
                <lb/>moon, which was now risen to a considerable height, I 
                <lb/>discovered a foot path, which I struck into and pursued, 
                <lb/>until I came in view of a neat cottage.—To continue my 
                <lb/>journey at this late hour, or to remain in the open fields 
                <lb/>all night, was equally repugnant to my feelings.—I re-
                <lb break="no"/>solved, therefore, to knock at the door, and request to re-
                <lb break="no"/>pose in the cottage for the night.—I knocked several 
                <lb/>times before I obtained any answer; at length a window 
                <lb/>opened, and a female voice enquired, “who is there?” 
                <lb/>“I have lost my way,” said I, “and intreat to be admit-
                <lb break="no"/>ted into the house until morning.”—“But who are you?” 
                <lb/>“I am an inoffensive woman, whom an unfortunate cir-
                <lb break="no"/>cumstance has obliged to be out at this late hour; but 
                <lb/>if you will let me in, and allow me to repose, I have no 
                <lb/>doubt but I can amply compensate you for your kind-
                <lb break="no"/>ness.”—“Well,” said the voice, “I will ask Mistress, and 
                <lb/>if she has a mind to let you come in, I will open the 
                <lb/>door—but be you sure you be a woman,” continued she, 
                <lb/>stretching her head out of the window to look at me, 
                <lb/>“because I thinks you looks monstriously like a ghost.” 
                <lb/>Having assured the simple rustic that I was a living being, 
                <lb/>she went from the window, and in about five minutes 
                <lb/>came down and admitted me within the door, at the same 
                <lb/>time saying,—“Mistress says she does not much like let-
                <lb break="no"/>ting strangers come in at night; but seeing as how you 
                <lb/>be a woman, and alone, you may come up and lay down 
                <lb/>by me.”—I perceived this simple wench as she was talk-
                <lb break="no"/>ing, to take hold of my shawl, my gown, and at last she 
                <lb/>laid her hand upon my arm—”Why you be warm flesh,” 
                <lb/>said she, “I did verily think you might be a spirit after 
                <lb/>all, which way did you come? for sarten you did not 
                <lb/>come through the coppice.” When I assured her that I 
                <lb/>did, she was all astonished, and enquired if I saw noth-
                <lb break="no"/>ing. I replied in the negative. She then told a tragical 
                <lb/>story of seduction, and murder of a child, the premature 
                <lb/>and horrid death of the mother, and finished with “Poor 
                <lb/><persName>Katy O’Conner</persName>, she walks every night in the coppice 
                <lb/>near the place where she buried her baby; sometimes in 
                <lb/>one shape, and sometimes in another; but if any body 
                <lb/>offers to go near her, she sets up a dreadful howl and

              <p>
                UPON the mention of ‘my Lord’s great house,’ I perceiv-
                <lb break="no"/>ed, it would be necessary for me to recommence my jour-
                <lb break="no"/>ney early in the morning, as it was more than probable 
                <lb/>that this girl had seen me there, if she went thither of-
                <lb break="no"/>ten, as I spent much of my time in the park and 
                <lb/>grounds, and was consequently in the way of being seen 
                <lb/>by the rustics who were daily passing through them, to 
                <lb/>the mansion. I questioned her as to her knowledge of 
                <lb/>the family, and learnt that this was a poultry and dairy 
                <lb/>house, belonging to his lordship, and was kept by her 
                <lb/>mistress who was a widow, and had been a domestic in 
                <lb/>the family many years. I learnt also, from this commu-
                <lb break="no"/>nicative creature, that this estate had belonged to the 
                <lb/>Marquis’s mother; that she was lately dead, that from 
                <lb/>this mother his immense wealth had proceeded; and I 
                <lb/>immediately concluded, that this was the lady of whom 
                <lb/>the house-keeper had spoken, when I imagined she was 
                <lb/>speaking of <persName>Mrs. Ryan</persName>.—At the first appearance of day, 
                <lb/>therefore, I arose; awoke my companion, who had been 
                <lb/>for several hours in a profound state of insensibility, and 
                <lb/>taking a sash which I had worn round my waist the day 
                <lb/>before, I presented it to her, telling her, I had no money; 
                <lb/>but I hoped that would satisfy her for the trouble I had 
                <lb/>given her.—She took it with delighted eagerness; it was 
                <lb/>bright lilac, and though the faint beams of day hardly 
                <lb/>allowed her to be a judge of the colour, she saw enough 
                <lb/>to be wonderfully pleased.—“Won’t you have some 
                <lb/>breakfast?” said she, holding up the ribbon, with her 
                <lb/>arm, raised above her head, to admire its length—“I 
                <lb/>will take a draught of milk,” I replied, “if you can give 
                <lb/>it me without offending your mistress.” We descended 
                <lb/>the stairs together; she brought me a bason of milk, and 
                <lb/>a slice of bread: I took them with thankfulness, and say-
                <lb break="no"/>ing I should soon find my way home, bade the credulous 
                <lb/>good natured creature adieu, and pursued my solitary 
                <lb/>way toward the city. I had wandered so far from the 
                <lb/>great road that the day was considerably advanced be-
                <lb break="no"/>fore I regained sight of it; and the moment I reached 
                <lb/>it, I again experienced the fear of being known, and on 
                <lb/>some pretext or other, obliged to go back to the man-
                <lb break="no"/>sion of the Marquis. Thus wandering, sometimes in the 
                <lb/>road, sometimes in by paths which seemed to tend to 
                <lb/>the same point, avoiding every passenger with the care 
                <lb/>and trepidation of a condemned criminal; the wearisome 
                <lb/>day passed on, and just at its close, I found myself at the 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>entrance of the city; having from fear and ignorance 
                <lb/>travelled several miles more than I otherwise should have 
                <lb/>had occasion to do; my limbs were fatigued, my feet sore, 
                <lb/>my spirits depressed, and my stomach faint; for the 
                <lb/>bread and milk taken at the cottage in the morning, was 
                <lb/>all the sustenance I had that day received.—Harassed 
                <lb/>and desponding as my mind was, I am not heroine e-
                <lb break="no"/>nough to say I forgot my bodily sufferings in the more 
                <lb/>poignant mental misery. I wept, my dear <persName>Ann</persName>, for very 
                <lb/>hunger and weariness, and every other feeling was for 
                <lb/>the time absorbed in the reflection that I had no where 
                <lb/>to repose my head, nor wherewithal to satisfy my appe-
                <lb break="no"/>tite.—At length I reached the house where I had lodged, 
                <lb/>previous to my making this unfortunate journey, and 
                <lb/>tapped at the door. The woman herself came to it. 
                <lb/>“So—so you are returned,” said she, with an imperti-
                <lb break="no"/>nent sneer, “and pray what has brought you back <seg xml:id="a119" corresp="#n119">in 
                  <lb/>this trim?”</seg><note xml:id="n119" corresp="#a119"><term style="font-style: italic">In this trim</term>: literally, in elegant dress; the expression is here used ironically.</note> “Let me come in,” said I, faintly, “I am 
                <lb/>fatigued almost to death, I have walked twelve or 
                <lb/>fourteen miles to day.” “And pray what is that to me?” 
                <lb/>said she fiercely, “you did not pay so well when you 
                <lb/>was here before, as to think I will put myself out of the 
                <lb/>way to take you in again.”—“Is my room occupied by 
                <lb/>any other?”—“Your room, quotha, pray which room is 
                <lb/>that? The one you left your trumpery in has been let to 
                <lb/>a gentlewoman this week past; one who can pay her way 
                <lb/>as she goes; none of your has <emph style="font­-style: italic">been unfortunate ladies</emph>, but a 
                <lb/>right arnest lady with plenty of guineas in her purse.”— 
                <lb/>“Have you sold my clothes?” I asked timidly. “Clothes! 
                <lb/>what clothes? the few rags you left in your trunk? No, since 
                <lb/>you chose to take all the best of your things with you 
                <lb/>when you went away, you may now take the rest; I’m 
                <lb/>sure I shan’t keep them; so when you have got a lodg-
                <lb break="no"/>ing you may send for them.” “But I can get no lodg-
                <lb break="no"/>ing; I have no money; let me only come in for to night,” 
                <lb/>exclaimed I frantickly. “I tell you I have no room for 
                <lb/>you,” said she, in a calm, deliberate accent, “what would 
                <lb/>the woman have? There’s plenty of lodgings to be had 
                <lb/>for such as you, but I never harbours nobody of suspi-
                <lb break="no"/>cious character, ater I knows em. You runn’d away from 
                <lb/>your husband in <placeName>England</placeName>—and then you runn’d away 
                <lb/>from your fine <persName>Madam Bellamy</persName>—and now I suppose 
                <lb/>you have runn’d away from the old man that you went 
                <lb/>into the country with, arter all your lying backwards 
                <lb/>and forwards about going to wait on, or be companion 
                <lb/>to a lady; pretty stories for them that choose to be-
                <lb break="no"/>lieve them; but I knows you better than to be <seg xml:id="a120" corresp="#n120">flammed</seg><note xml:id="n120" corresp="#a120"><term style="font-style: italic">Flammed</term>: deceived or conned.</note> 
                <lb/>so; you is too proud to wait on any body, and as to 
                <lb/>a companion, lord help us, I wonders what lady would 
                <lb/>bemean themselves to company with you.— Well, what 
                <lb/>does the woman stand for? I tells you you can’t come 
                <lb/>in” She then shut the door, and left me standing on 
                <lb/>the step, holding by a slight railing, which was on one 
                <lb/>side. I slowly descended the steps, and going a few pa-
                <lb break="no"/>ces from the inhospitable door, sat down on some old 
                <lb/>timber which lay in the street—I shed no tears—my 
                <lb/>heart did not beat with violence.—I leaned my head on 
                <lb/>my hands, resting my elbows on my knees, and a torpid 
                <lb/>coldness pervaded every sense.—I heard human voices, 
                <lb/>but they spoke not to me.—I raised my eyes; a small 
                <lb/>shop before me displayed some rolls, two or three <seg xml:id="a121" corresp="#n121">polo-
                  <lb break="no"/>nies</seg><note xml:id="n121" corresp="#a121"><term style="font-style: italic">Polonies</term>: dried pork sausages.</note> and some cheese; but they were not for me.—I saw 
                <lb/>lights pass into the chambers of the surrounding houses, 
                <lb/>indicating that the inhabitants were retiring to rest.—
                <lb/>Alas, thought I, there is no place of rest for me. To 
                <lb/>describe my feelings at this moment, this horrid mo-
                <lb break="no"/>ment; I could neither weep, think, nor pray.—My 
                <lb/><choice><orig>hand</orig><reg>hands</reg></choice> relaxed their support—my head sunk; I reclined 
                <lb/>myself on the timber, and a sleep, like that of death 
                <lb/>seemed stealing over me.—At that moment I felt a warm 
                <lb/>hand touch mine. “Are you asleep?” said a soft, fe-
                <lb break="no"/>male voice. I raised myself, but could not articulate a 
                <lb/>word; my tongue clave to the roof of my mouth. “My 
                <lb/><choice><orig>neighbour</orig><reg>neighbor</reg></choice>,” said the same voice, assisting me to rise upon 
                <lb/>my feet, “tells me you want a lodging, she is full, I have 
                <lb/>a room that is empty—come home with me, you have 
                <lb/>had a long walk to day—come, we shall not disagree a-
                <lb break="no"/>bout the price.” So gently leading forward as she spoke, 
                <lb/>without my being able to speak, or resist her offered 
                <lb/>kindness, the good creature brought me to her home, and 
                <lb/>gave me some <seg xml:id="a122" corresp="#n122">wine-whey,</seg><note xml:id="n122" corresp="#a122"><term style="font-style: italic">Wine-whey</term>: whey—the watery part of milk left when the curd is separated—made by adding wine.</note> helped to undress and put me 
                <lb/>into bed, and telling me if I wanted any thing in the

                EXCESSIVE fatigue and complete dejection, had the 
                <lb/>same effect on my frame that a powerful opiate would 
                <lb/>have had. I fell into a profound sleep, nor did I awake 
                <lb/>until the sun darting his rays upon my face, chaced the 
                <lb/>sweet oblivion of my senses; I opened my eyes and look-
                <lb break="no"/>ing around me; was sometime before I could compre-
                <lb break="no"/>hend where I was, or how I came there. The room, the 
                <lb/>bed, every article of furniture, though clean, bespoke 
                <lb/>poverty. I closed my eyes again, and endeavoured to 
                <lb/>collect my thoughts; by degrees the torturing circum-
                <lb break="no"/>stances of the preceeding day returned to my recollec-
                <lb break="no"/>tion; my heart which on my first awaking had beat vi-
                <lb break="no"/>olently, now subsided, into something like <choice><sic>tranqulity</sic><corr>tranquility</corr></choice>; 
                <lb/>I felt a gentle emotion steal over it, it was gratitude to 
                <lb/>the good creature who had humanely snatched me from 
                <lb/>the horrors of passing the night on those timbers on 
                <lb/>which I had sunk supine and hopeless, and shielded me 
                <lb/>from the dreadful insults or casualties, to which such a 
                <lb/>situation exposed me; from gratitude to her my thoughts 
                <lb/>elevated themselves to the Divine power, whose immedi-
                <lb break="no"/>ate agent she was. The tears flowed plenteously, but 
                <lb/>they tranquilized my spirits, and I wished to arise and 
                <lb/>thank my protectress for her humanity. I left 
                <lb/>my bed, and began to dress myself; but in a few 
                <lb/>moments a faintish sickness came over me, and I 
                <lb/>sunk again on the bed side. I now became sensible 
                <lb/>to the calls of hunger; they were imperious, and I en-
                <lb break="no"/>deavoured to finish putting on my clothes that I might 
                <lb/>solicit from my good hostess something to satisfy its crav-
                <lb break="no"/>ings.
              </p>
              <p>
                I imagine she must have heard me stir, for she came in 
                <lb/>and kindly enquiring how I had slept, assisted me to 
                <lb/>finish dressing myself; she led me into the next room 
                <lb/>where a comfortable breakfast was prepared, which I 
                <lb/>partook with an eagerness, and thought it tasted more ex-
                <lb break="no"/>quisitely than any breakfast I had ever before enjoyed. When 
                <lb/>I had finished my meal, reflection and honesty told me 
                <lb/>it would be unjust to continue with the woman, whose 
                <lb/>appearance denoted her poverty, and partake of her 
                <lb/>store, which in all probability, was scanty enough for 
                <lb/>herself—Yet what to do, or how to preface a discourse 
                <lb/>which I feared must end in my becoming an outcast, I was 
                <lb/>at an equal loss.—At length she seemingly, without de-
                <lb break="no"/>sign, led to the subject by remarking, that she believed I 
                <lb/>had lodged in that neighbourhood before; I replied in 
                <lb/>the affirmative. “Neighbour <persName>Conolly</persName>,” said she, “has 
                <lb/>let her room to a mighty fine lady, who I suppose, will 
                <lb/>stay a good while; she has a sight of folks come after 
                <lb/>her, and I suppose pays handsomely for the use of the 
                <lb/><choice><orig>parlour</orig><reg>parlor</reg></choice>; to be sure, I have not got a room entirely to 
                <lb/>yourself to offer, but if such a place as I can offer will 
                <lb/>do—” “Ah, my kind hearted woman,” said I, laying my 
                <lb/>hand on her arm, “I have no means of paying you, even 
                <lb/>for my last night’s lodging and this morning’s refresh-
                <lb break="no"/>ment.” “Well, well, may be not now,” said she hastily, 
                <lb/>“but you will have; you can work at your needle, 
                <lb/>I suppose?” “Yes, very well and very fast,” said I, 
                <lb/>“either <seg xml:id="a125" corresp="#n125">plain work, dresden, or embroidery.”</seg><note xml:id="n125" corresp="#a125"><term style="font-style: italic">Plain work, dresden, or embroidery</term>: plain work typically referred to basic sewing, embroidery to ornamental work on clothing, and Dresden work to the finest and most detailed embroidery.</note> “And 
                <lb/>you are willing to work, I hope?” she asked seriously—
                <lb/>“Indeed I am; only procure me employment, and you 
                <lb/>shall see I will not be idle,” I replied with earnestness.—
                <lb/>“Then depend on it, my good lady, we shall do very 
                <lb/>well; a woman who is honest and both able and willing 
                <lb/>to work, will never be suffered to want while there is 
                <lb/>one good christian upon earth; but I say honest, she must 
                <lb/>be <emph style="font­-style: italic">honest</emph> in <emph style="font­-style: italic">thought</emph>, in word, in <emph style="font­-style: italic">deed</emph>.”—Spite of my uneasy 
                <lb/>situation, I could not help smiling at the woman’s ear-
                <lb break="no"/>nestness—“I hope I am honest in thought, word, and 
                <lb/>deed,” said I.—“I hope you are,” she replied, gravely, 
                <lb/>“but you have been living with some bad folks, that 
                <lb/>old ugly <persName>madam Bellamy</persName>, and her good for nothing 
                <lb/>daughter, wan’t fit company for an honest young wo-
                <lb break="no"/>man; neighbor <persName>Conolly</persName> too, said some hard things of 
                <lb/>you last night, but I thought if you were ever so naught, 
                <lb/>that was no reason why you should die in the street, so I 
                <lb/>took you in; but now I must tell you I am willing to 
                <lb/>have you stay here, and I can get you work enough; 
                <lb/>but I must have no men folks coming after you, no walk-
                <lb break="no"/>ing out with old gentlemen, no advertising for places.—
                <cb/>
                <lb/>When we have had a hard day’s work you and I will 
                <lb/>go and fetch a walk together, and a sundays we’ll go to 
                <lb/>church; I always goes to a little chapel two or three 
                <lb/>miles out of town, because the walk is good for one’s 
                <lb/>health.”—I readily subscribed to all these conditions, 
                <lb/>more pleased than offended, with her blunt sincerity—
                <lb/>but she had not finished, “you must know,” said she, 
                <lb/><choice><sic>there</sic><corr>“there</corr></choice> is a gentleman comes here very often; heaven 
                <lb/>bless him, he loves to come and see his poor old <persName>Peg</persName>. I 
                <lb/>lived in his father’s family when he was a child; 
                <lb/>though he has been very unfortunate, I love him as well 
                <lb/>as if he had been a rich lord or duke; but you must not 
                <lb/>see him; no, nor even know his name, for reasons that I 
                <lb/>know of—he don’t come here very often, but for fear of 
                <lb/>his coming unexpectedly, you must live and work in the 
                <lb/>little bedroom; he never goes in there, and though the 
                <lb/>room is small and has a bed in it, it is lightsome and clean, 
                <lb/>though I say it.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “I have no objection to make to your proposal,” said 
                <lb/>I, “I have only to remark, that I must write one letter 
                <lb/>to <placeName>England</placeName>; that letter you shall yourself put in the 
                <lb/>Post-Office, and if you will take the trouble, to enquire for 
                <lb/>the answer; and when that answer arrives, you shall see 
                <lb/>the contents. I will deal openly with you; I will in-
                <lb break="no"/>form you of my real situation, but at present, I am inad-
                <lb break="no"/>equate to the task of speaking much.” And really, my 
                <lb/>dear <persName>Ann</persName>, I felt very ill; my head began to ache, and 
                <lb/>the fluttering at the heart to return, accompanied with 
                <lb/>excessive faintness. The good old woman, whose name 
                <lb/>was <persName>Peggy M‘Lean</persName>, saw my situation, and helped me 
                <lb/>into the bed-room; smoothed the pillow, assisted me in 
                <lb/>lying down, covered me, and with the simple exclama-
                <lb break="no"/>tion of “Poor thing,” pronounced in a voice of com-
                <lb break="no"/>passion, left me, shutting the door softly after her.
              </p>
              <p>
                I soon fell asleep; but it was neither sound nor refresh-
                <lb break="no"/>ing; my fatiguing journey, the barbarous language of 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Conolly</persName>, the anguish I endured when she shut the 
                <lb/>door upon me, were in this feverish slumber again re-
                <lb break="no"/>peated. I started; my flesh burned, my pulse throbbed; 
                <lb/>extreme thirst urged me to rise, but the weight on my 
                <lb/>eyelids, and the strong inclination I felt to dose, pre-
                <lb break="no"/>vented my attempting it. At noon, <persName>Peggy</persName>, or as I shall 
                <lb/>call her, <persName>Mrs. M’Lean</persName>, brought me a little broth; I 
                <lb/>could take but a few spoonfulls. “You are sick, child,” 
                <lb/>said she, “I must have a Doctor to you.” “No,” said I, 
                <lb/>“it is only fatigue, I walked a long way yesterday, and 
                <lb/>was very warm; rest will restore me.”—But rest now fled 
                <lb/>from me: I remained on the bed until towards evening, 
                <lb/>without forgetting myself a moment; I then arose, and 
                <lb/>took a little tea, but was unable to sit up. Retiring for 
                <lb/>the night, I asked <persName>Mrs. M’Lean</persName> where she slept? The 
                <lb/>good creature evaded my question, but on my repeating 
                <lb/>it, confessed she had no other bed, and had slept the 
                <lb/>preceding night on a rug upon the floor, in the next 
                <lb/>room. What an act of christian charity was this, my 
                <lb/><persName>Ann</persName>, that a woman should deprive herself of her own 
                <lb/>bed to put into it a poor wretch whom she had reason 
                <lb/>to suppose was lost to virtue, and who had no recomm-
                <lb break="no"/>endation but her distress.
              </p>
              <p>
                From that night until the expiration of the ten follow-
                <lb break="no"/>ing days, I was confined by a fever, occasioned by being 
                <lb/>exposed so long in a state of inactivity to the night air, af-
                <lb break="no"/>ter having been heated by walking; but at length I recov-
                <lb break="no"/>ered strength enough to work, and obtained sufficient 
                <lb/>employment in <seg xml:id="a126" corresp="#n126">tambouring and embroidering muslin,</seg><note xml:id="n126" corresp="#a126"><term style="font-style: italic">Tambouring</term>: doing embroidery work in a tambour, a circular frame for keeping cloth taut; <term style="font-style: italic">muslin</term> is a simple cotton weave.</note> to 
                <lb/>supply me with the necessaries of life. I wrote to <persName>Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName>, but received no answer. I began to experience 
                <lb/>something like entire resignation to my fate; for I saw 
                <lb/>no way of again revisiting my dear native land, but by 
                <lb/>strict parsimony, endeavouring to save a sufficient sum to 
                <lb/>bear my expenses thither; but it would take a considera-
                <lb break="no"/>ble time to save so much.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was one evening at work with <persName>Old Margaret</persName>, 
                <lb/>when a loud knock at the door made us start; she open-
                <lb break="no"/>ed it, and I heard a sound of altercation; I drew near the 
                <lb/>stairs to listen—a voice I thought I knew, caught my ear; 
                <lb/>I descended half way down, and was convinced I had not 
                <lb/>been deceived; I rushed down the remaining steps and 
                <lb/>out at the door, and on recovering from a momentary 
                <lb/>insensibility, I found myself in the arms of my brother!

                I INFORMED you in my last, that <persName>Sarah</persName> had written 
                <lb/>to her husband, to announce to him her arrival in <placeName>Eng-
                  <lb break="no"/>land</placeName>; he returned no answer, and I began to think all 
                <lb/>connection between them was forever at an end; indeed, 
                <lb/>I did not much regret it, only as it respected her own i-
                <lb break="no"/>deas of propriety, which led her to wish to see him, that 
                <lb/>she might clear up all misconceptions, which, aspersed as 
                <lb/>her character has been, was absolutely necessary to be 
                <lb/>done; though, until she saw him, and knew exactly 
                <lb/>what had been said by that arch fiend <persName>Bellamy</persName>, or wheth-
                <lb break="no"/>er she had really written at all or not; to attempt an 
                <lb/>explanation before she was accused, was to acknowledge 
                <lb/>a consciousness of error. One thing I rather imagine 
                <lb/>appears enigmatical to you, the assertion of her being 
                <lb/>kept by <persName>O’Donnell</persName>; I will unravel the mystery. <persName>O’Don-
                  <lb break="no"/>nell</persName>, still hampered by the effects of his wife’s extrava-
                <lb break="no"/>gance, and not choosing to appeal to a Court of Justice 
                <lb/>for a divorce from her, lest a public exposition of his 
                <lb/>conduct, in regard to her before marriage, might point 
                <lb/>him out as an object of contempt and ridicule, was con-
                <lb break="no"/>tent to live within the rules of the prison; and being a 
                <lb/>man of considerable ability, and literary knowledge, gains 
                <lb/>a very decent subsistence, by writing, selecting and cor-
                <lb break="no"/>recting a Periodical Publication, which is issued to the 
                <lb/>world by a principal bookseller. <persName>Peggy McLean</persName> had 
                <lb/>lived with his parents, and <persName>O’Donnell</persName> retained a very 
                <lb/>strong affection for the worthy creature, who had indul-
                <lb break="no"/>ged many a vagary of childhood, and concealed many 
                <lb/>a boyish fault, which might have exposed the cul-
                <lb break="no"/>prit to a whipping if discovered. His lodging was near 
                <lb/>her’s, and she washed and repaired his linen; this occa-
                <lb break="no"/>sioned a frequent intercourse between them. The eve-
                <lb break="no"/>ning our poor <persName>Sarah</persName> was driven from the door of the 
                <lb/>unfeeling <persName>Conolly</persName>, <persName>O’Donnell</persName>, who had been to pay his 
                <lb/>ancient friend a visit, and was passing just as she was on 
                <lb/>the steps entreating admission, he heard the name of 
                <lb/><persName>Bellamy</persName> and stopped; a few moments attention to the 
                <lb/>scene convinced him <persName>Sarah</persName> was in great distress, and 
                <lb/>from his knowledge of the persons she had been among, 
                <lb/>he thought it more than probable, she might be an in-
                <lb break="no"/>nocent, ill used woman. He saw her sink down upon 
                <lb/>the timber, and running hastily back to <persName>Peggy</persName>, thus ad-
                <lb break="no"/>dressed her:—“Good <persName>Peggy</persName>, go directly into the lane, 
                <lb/>there is a poor creature in distress. From what I have 
                <lb/>heard her say, she has no means of procuring a lodging. 
                <lb/>I know nothing more about her, she may have brought 
                <lb/>her misery on herself, but be that as it may, she must not 
                <lb/>lie in the street.” “No, indeed, heaven forbid she 
                <lb/>should,” said <persName>Peggy</persName>, “while <persName>Peg McLean</persName> has a mat-
                <lb break="no"/>rass and a blanket; come, shew me where she is, and tell 
                <lb/>me what will I say to her.” “Speak to her as from 
                <lb/>yourself, for on no account must my name be mention-
                <lb break="no"/>ed to her, tell her you have a room you can let her have, 
                <lb/>take her home with you, treat her kindly, and you shall 
                <lb/>be no loser; but I will never see her, and again I charge 
                <lb/>you never mention my name to her.”  After <persName>Peggy</persName> had 
                <lb/>executed <persName>O’Donnell’s</persName> benevolent commission, in the man-
                <lb break="no"/>ner <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, in her journal, has related, he tapped 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>at the door, and softly enquiring if her lodger was retir-
                <lb break="no"/>ed, hearing she was in bed, he ventured in, and inform-
                <lb break="no"/>ed the honest creature of what he had gleaned from her 
                <lb/>talkative and malignant neighbor, concluding with these 
                <lb/>words: “If she is virtuously inclined, she will be wil-
                <lb break="no"/>ling to work, and I have no doubt but she can have em-
                <lb break="no"/>ployment from some of the warehouses; when you have 
                <lb/>talked with her, if we find her what I think she is, I will 
                <lb/>mention her to the wife of my friend, the bookseller, 
                <lb/>who, I am sure, will interest herself to get her work; 
                <lb/>but you see it would be highly improper, to let her know 
                <lb/>I have done any thing for her, knowing what she does 
                <lb/>of my wife, she would not, I am sure, receive the small-
                <lb break="no"/>est favour from me; her delicacy and prudence, if she 
                <lb/>is possessed in any degree of those amiable qualities, 
                <lb/>would equally forbid it.” How this plan was executed, 
                <lb/>we have been informed, and as <persName>O’Donnell</persName> frequently 
                <lb/>called to enquire after her, though he never saw her, 
                <lb/><persName>Bellamy</persName>, who it seems had spies upon her, wrested these 
                <lb/>circumstances into a tale of dishonour, and retailed them 
                <lb/>in order to injure the woman whom she never could 
                <lb/>forgive, for daring to avow her detestation of vice in her 
                <lb/>presence.

                I BROKE off abruptly, being told <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> wished 
                <lb/>me to come down, as there was a gentleman below who 
                <lb/>would not tell his business (though it concerned herself) 
                <lb/>to any but me. I obeyed the summons, and found an 
                <lb/>elderly person, whose appearance and manner evidenced 
                <lb/>the well bred man.—“I come, Madam,” said he, “to 
                <lb/>ask a question of this lady; but it must be in your pres-
                <lb break="no"/>ence, and you must confirm or contradict her answers, as 
                <lb/>I have from report such an opinion of your integrity—” 
                <lb/>“Hold, Sir,” said I, interrupting him, “whatever <persName>Mrs. 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName> asserts, to those who know her, needs no other 
                <lb/>confirmation; her characteristic is sincerity, nor did I 
                <lb/>ever know her in the smallest degree to deviate from it.” 
                <lb/>“Well, Madam,” he replied, “she has, no doubt then, in 
                <lb/>the sincerity of her heart, related to you every occur-
                <lb break="no"/>rence which took place during her late residence in 
                <lb/><placeName>Dublin</placeName>?” “She has.” “I am commissioned by <persName>Mr. 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName>, to enquire whether you, Madam, (turning to 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName>) were, during that period, acquainted with <persName>Mr. 
                  <lb/>O’Donnell</persName><choice><orig>.</orig><reg>?</reg></choice>” “I was,” she replied, with a steady voice, 
                <lb/>though the glow of resentment crossed her cheek, as she 
                <lb/>remembered, how vilely, on his account, she had been 
                <lb/>traduced. “I received obligations from him which I 
                <lb/>can never repay, and the grateful remembrance of them 
                <lb/>are deeply engraven on my heart.” “You are candid, 
                <lb/>indeed, Madam,” said he, with a look of astonishment; 
                <lb/>“He was your frequent visitor, during the latter part 
                <lb/>of your residence in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>?” “He was frequently at 
                <lb/>the house where I lodged, but I never saw him until 
                <lb/>within a few days of my quitting that place—but why 
                <lb/>these interrogations, Sir? if <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> wishes to find 
                <lb/>me innocent, he may easily trace me through every scene 
                <lb/>in which I was engaged during my absence from <placeName>Eng-
                  <lb break="no"/>land</placeName>. If he wishes to believe me guilty, he had better 
                <lb/>avoid all particular investigation of my conduct; I 
                <lb/>court, rather than shrink, from scrutiny, and letters ad-
                <lb break="no"/>dressed to—” “Pardon me, dear Madam, <persName>Mr. Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName>, is in no condition to make this scrutiny, and could 
                <lb/>he behold you at this moment as I do, truth is so strong-

              <p>
                <persName>Sarah</persName> arose from her seat. “I will go,” said she<choice><orig>,</orig><reg>;</reg></choice> 
                <lb/>“lead me to him Sir; I will go, and perform my duty 
                <lb/>in attending him; if, when he recovers, he bids me leave 
                <lb/>him, I can return again to the only friend fortune has 
                <lb/>left me, and she will not refuse to receive me.” She 
                <lb/>held out her hand to me; the tears gushed from her 
                <lb/>eyes, and hastily throwing on her bonnet and cloak, the 
                <lb/>gentleman led her to a coach, leaving me a card where I 
                <lb/>might find her, and they drove off.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have heard from her every day since; <persName>Darnley</persName> yet 
                <lb/>continues ill, but is, I believe, now out of danger. I am 
                <lb/>to see her to day, and will write again soon.

                COMFORT seems again to dawn on our good <persName>Sa-
                  <lb break="no"/>rah</persName>; her tender assiduity, her care, and unremitting 
                <lb/>watchfulness, have been the means in the hands of an 
                <lb/>all powerful God, of restoring <persName>Darnley</persName> to health. They 
                <lb/>also have awakened in his heart a degree of that affec-
                <lb break="no"/>tion he once professed so ardently to feel for her, and 
                <lb/>it certainly is more likely to be permanent, since what 
                <lb/>he experienced for her at the time of their union, was 
                <lb/>the effervescence of youthful passion; but the present 
                <lb/>sentiment is softened by gratitude, and founded on es-
                <lb break="no"/>teem. The old gentleman who came to inform <persName>Sarah</persName> 
                <lb/>of her husband’s illness, is a <persName>Mr. Vaughan</persName>, a <seg xml:id="a132" corresp="#n132">half pay 
                  <lb/>officer,</seg><note xml:id="n132" corresp="#a132"><term style="font-style: italic">Half pay officer</term>: a retired military officer.</note> who has a wife and several children to main-
                <lb break="no"/>tain; and a very confined income to do it with; he 
                <lb/>was in service at the commencement of the war, but 
                <lb/>receiving a wound, returned home, and his health has 
                <lb/>since been in so precarious a state, as to prevent his a-
                <lb break="no"/>gain joining his regiment, which continued still abroad. 
                <lb/>To increase the means of living, they let part of their 
                <lb/>house to several respectable gentlemen, who boarded 
                <lb/>with them at an easy rate, and experienced that kind 
                <lb/>of style and manner of conducting the family, table, 
                <lb/>&amp;c. as is peculiarly agreeable to men of good educa-
                <lb break="no"/>tion and polished manners. Here <persName>Darnley</persName> has board-
                <lb break="no"/>ed for some time past, being recommended to the fam-
                <lb break="no"/>ily by an elderly person, who writes in the counting 
                <lb/>house with him, and who had some little knowledge of 
                <lb/>his character, and knew from good authority how fool-
                <lb break="no"/>ishly he had trifled away his happiness, and involved 
                <lb/>himself in debts, by being subject to the dominion of 
                <lb/>an unprincipled woman. <persName>Mr. Vaughan</persName>, though ad-
                <lb break="no"/>vanced considerably in life, is uncommonly attractive 
                <lb/>in his manners; his education has been liberal; his 
                <lb/>understanding is far above mediocrity, and having 
                <lb/>seen a great deal of the world; was qualified for giving 
                <lb/>counsel to the thoughtless and inexperienced. He 
                <lb/>soon gained <persName>Darnley’s</persName> confidence; he imparted to this 
                <lb/>new friend, the doubts which had arisen in his mind con-
                <lb break="no"/>cerning his wife’s conduct, during her absence from 
                <lb/>him; shewed him the letter <persName>Bellamy</persName> had written to 
                <lb/>him, and which accused poor <persName>Sarah</persName> of almost every 
                <lb/>vice. <persName>Vaughan</persName> inquired if he ever had any reason to 
                <lb/>suspect her while she was with him; what her gener-
                <lb break="no"/>al conduct and principles were, and learnt that though 
                <lb/>volatile and improvident in many things, she cherished 
                <lb/>the strictest principles of virtue and religion, and ut-
                <lb break="no"/>ter abhorrence of vice; that while herself by look, by 
                <lb/>word, or action, never in her gayest and most thoughtless 
                <lb/>moments transgressed the laws of female propriety, she 
                <lb/>was ever ready to overlook the faults of others; pity their 
                <lb/>errors and relieve their distresses, though the natural 
                <lb/>consequence of those errors. He concluded, that it was 
                <lb/>not very probable that such a woman would become all 
                <lb/>at once abandoned to vice and profligacy. This he 
                <lb/>frequently urged, and advised him to write to his wife, 
                <lb/>send her money to discharge her debts, and invite her 
                <lb/>home. <persName>Darnley</persName> was inclined to do this, and would ac-
                <lb break="no"/>tually have put his design into execution, when he re-
                <lb break="no"/>ceived her letter, written the day after her being re-
                <lb break="no"/>ceived into the dwelling of <persName>Peggy McLean</persName>, but the 
                <lb/>very day in which he formed this resolution, another 
                <lb/>diabolical epistle arrived; not from <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> as be-
                <lb break="no"/>fore, but from <persName>Jessy Romain</persName>, <emph style="font­-style: italic">alias</emph> <persName>Ryan</persName>; 
                <lb/>who, though unacquainted with the place of his resi-
                <lb break="no"/>dence, rather than not have a chance to traduce his 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>innocent wife, directed her letter to a coffee house in 
                <lb/>the city, where she knew, if he was in <placeName>London</placeName>, he 
                <lb/>would certainly find it, as he seldom passed a day 
                <lb/>without calling there. This letter contained an ac-
                <lb break="no"/>count that might have staggered the faith of almost any 
                <lb/>one. <persName>Sarah</persName> was represented as having resided several 
                <lb/>weeks at the <persName>Marquis of <placeName>H—</placeName>’s</persName>, and eloping 
                <lb/>from him one night to <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, in company with a 
                <lb/>married man, by whom she had been ever since sup-
                <lb break="no"/>ported.
              </p>
              <p>
                The consequence was, that when <persName>Sarah</persName> wrote to in-
                <lb break="no"/>form him of her arrival in <placeName>England</placeName>, he flew into a violent 
                <lb/>paroxysm of rage, and swore he would never see her 
                <lb/>again. All <persName>Mr. Vaughan’s</persName> arguments were vain. But 
                <lb/>when from his fall, he found a long and painful confine-
                <lb break="no"/>ment would most likely be the consequence, nay, per-
                <lb break="no"/>haps the loss of life would follow, the good man re-
                <lb break="no"/>newed his solicitations that he would see and be recon-
                <lb break="no"/>ciled to his wife. <persName>Darnley</persName> said faintly, “If I could 
                <lb/>but think her innocent, and yet if she is, <persName>Mr. Vaughan</persName>, 
                <lb/>how can I expect her to pardon my neglect of her. If 
                <lb/>she is innocent, I have used her shamefully—cruelly.” 
                <lb/><persName>Mr. Vaughan</persName> found the heat of his passion was subsi-
                <lb break="no"/>ded, and imagined he would be even glad to find she 
                <lb/>had been traduced; he therefore resolved himself to 
                <lb/>see her, to question her concerning the subject of the 
                <lb/>information officiously given by <persName>Ryan</persName> and <persName>Bellamy</persName>, 
                <lb/>and draw his conclusions from the manner in which 
                <lb/>she should receive and reply to his questions. Her 
                <lb/>frankness charmed him, and the readiness, even to eag-
                <lb break="no"/>erness, which she shewed to go immediately and at-
                <lb break="no"/>tend her husband, prejudiced him highly in her favor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their meeting was singular, yet affecting.— “I have 
                <lb/>brought,” said <persName>Mr. Vaughan</persName>, opening the curtains of 
                <lb/>the sick man’s bed,— “I have brought <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>to nurse you.”—“Who, <persName>Sarah</persName>?” said he, “where is 
                <lb/>she?”—“I am here, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>,” cried our friend, 
                <lb/>advancing and putting forth her hand.—“I am grieved 
                <lb/>for your accident, and wish it may be in my power, by 
                <lb/>performing every kind office, to alleviate your suffer-
                <lb break="no"/>ings and accelerate your recovery.”—“Did you come 
                <lb/>voluntarily?” said he, “was it affection prompted?” 
                <lb/>“I came voluntarily, <persName>George</persName>,” she replied gravely, 
                <lb/>“I never was, never can be, a professor; you must 
                <lb/>judge of my motives from my conduct; actions speak 
                <lb/>louder than words.”—“Oh,” said he emphatically, 
                <lb/>“were I to be judged by my actions—” She laid her 
                <lb/>hand on his which lay outside of the bed, and looking at 
                <lb/>him with an impression of kindness, “We have both 
                <lb/>erred,” said she, “but let us not now talk of it; time 
                <lb/>past cannot be recalled, but it remains with ourselves 
                <lb/>to make the future either happy or miserable; for the 
                <lb/>present let us think only of your getting well.” “Do 
                <lb/>you wish it, <persName>Sarah</persName>?”— “How unavailing the question, 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName>, if I do not wish it, I would not avow such an 
                <lb/>indifference, and if I say I do, you may suspect me of 
                <lb/>dissimulation.” “No, <persName>Sarah</persName>, I believe you would not as-
                <lb break="no"/>sert what you did not feel. You ever were sincere.”—
                <lb/>“I am so now, when I tell you I ardently wish your 
                <lb/>recovery.”
              </p>
              <p>
                When <persName>Darnley</persName> was well enough to sit up, <persName>Vaughan</persName> 
                <lb/>thought as there was every reason to suppose a recon-
                <lb break="no"/>ciliation and reunion would take place between him 
                <lb/>and his wife, it was to be wished that reunion might be 
                <lb/>rendered permanent; he therefore proposed to <persName>Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName> that he would write to the <persName>Marquis of <placeName>H—</placeName></persName>, and 
                <lb/>to <persName>O’Donnel</persName>, as an indifferent person who had heard 
                <lb/>these reports, and wished to know the truth, as it was 
                <lb/>of infinite consequence that <persName>Mrs. Darnley’s</persName> character 
                <lb/>should either be effectually cleared, or at any rate the 
                <lb/>truth should be fully known; to this he assented, and <persName>Mr. 
                  <lb/>Vaughan</persName> wrote immediately.—<persName>Darnley</persName> awaits the an=
                <lb break="no"/>swer of these letters with anxiety; I am equally impa-
                <lb break="no"/>tient with him, but my impatience proceeds from a wish 
                <lb/>to witness the triumph of my beloved Sarah, and in the 
                <lb/>pleasure that event would confer, I am sure you will 
                <lb/>partake.

                THE expected letters from <placeName>Dublin</placeName> have arrived, and 
                <lb/>have effectually removed every doubt from the mind of 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName>; his health is perfectly re-established, and next 
                <lb/>week they remove into <placeName>Warwickshire</placeName>; but I must in-
                <lb break="no"/>form you of the cause of this removal. I really hope 
                <lb/>my dear <persName>Sarah</persName> has her happiest days yet to come; and 
                <lb/>that they will commence the moment she is again com-

                <persName>Darnley</persName>, apparently delighted with the reconciliation 
                <lb/>which has taken place, seemed only uneasy that his in-
                <lb break="no"/>come was so contracted as not to allow him to procure 
                <lb/>lodgings and attendants such as he thought becoming 
                <lb/>his wife. This vanity still predominates in him; but 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah’s</persName> taste for shew and expense is entirely quench-
                <lb break="no"/>ed; and she sat about purchasing some plain furniture 
                <lb/>for two small rooms with that complacent cheerfulness 
                <lb/>which evinced her contented mind. But before they 
                <lb/>were settled, or had fixed on any apartments to re-
                <lb break="no"/>move to, a gentlemen one morning called on <persName>Darnley</persName>, 
                <lb/>bringing a letter from the <persName>Marquis of <placeName>H—</placeName></persName>, to this 
                <lb/>effect: “That the esteem <persName>Mrs. Darnley’s</persName> conduct 
                <lb/>had impressed on his mind, had made him take an in-
                <lb break="no"/>terest in whatever concerned her happiness; that he 
                <lb/>had been informed that misfortune had rendered their 
                <lb/>situation perplexing in regard to pecuniary circumstan-
                <lb break="no"/>ces, and being fully sensible that any offer of assist-
                <lb break="no"/>ance in the form of benevolence would be rejected, he 
                <lb/>had taken the liberty to mention <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> to a gen-
                <lb break="no"/>tleman who wanted a steward to superintend his es-
                <lb break="no"/>tates in <placeName>England</placeName>, which were extensive; he being obli-
                <lb break="no"/>ged from a public employment to reside in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, of 
                <lb/>which he was a native; that the steward would be ex-
                <lb break="no"/>pected to reside on the principal estate, which was in 
                <lb/><placeName>Warwickshire</placeName>; that a neat house was provided for his 
                <lb/>family within a few miles of the town of <placeName>Warwick</placeName>; 
                <lb/>that the salary was three hundred pounds a year, and 
                <lb/>half a year would be paid in advance on his entering on 
                <lb/>the employment; which he might do immediately, 
                <lb/>should he accept the offer; that there was two rooms 
                <lb/>which had been fitted up at the mansion-house for an 
                <lb/>aged relation, who had ended her life there; and as the 
                <lb/>furniture of those rooms was entirely useless to the 
                <lb/>owner, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> was requested to accept of it as it 
                <lb/>might answer until she could accommodate herself 
                <lb/>with something better.”
              </p>
              <p>
                This was the purport of the letter, but you must have 
                <lb/>seen it, to form a just idea of the delicacy which ran 
                <lb/>through the whole; the style was elegant, and every 
                <lb/>sentence expressed, that though addressed to her hus-
                <lb break="no"/>band, it was expected to meet the eye of <persName>Sarah</persName>; that 
                <lb/>he considered her as a superior and highly respectable 
                <lb/>woman, and was at once studious to avoid wounding 
                <lb/>her delicacy or sensibility. The gentleman who brought 
                <lb/>the letter was empowered to engage with <persName>Darnley</persName>, and 
                <lb/>advance the money. It may readily be supposed that 
                <lb/>this was an offer not to be rejected by a man who, wri-
                <lb break="no"/>ting with the utmost assiduity in a merchant’s comp-
                <lb break="no"/>ting house, could earn no more than seventy-five pounds 
                <lb/>a year, and whose taste for expense was ever hurrying 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>him into thoughtless extravagance; he closed with the 
                <lb/>proposed terms with eagerness; the gentleman paid 
                <lb/>him a hundred and fifty guineas, and informed him, that 
                <lb/>by <persName>Sir Richard Bourke’s</persName> order, a post chaise would be 
                <lb/>ready to convey them to the estate, which is 
                <lb/>called <placeName>Woodlands</placeName>, on any day in the ensuing week they 
                <lb/>should be ready to go. It will be particularly pleasing 
                <lb/>to <persName>Sarah</persName> to reside in the country; and if there should 
                <lb/>be a few rational, well informed persons in her vicinity, 
                <lb/>I am certain she will feel no regret at being obliged to 
                <lb/>relinquish the gaiety of a town life. I hope <persName>Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>will keep away from the town, as he will not be so cer-
                <lb break="no"/>tain to meet with companions, likely to draw him into 
                <lb/>his former follies in a country village, as in a populous 
                <lb/>town. Keep him from low and unprincipled associates, 
                <lb/>and the man will do well enough; but he is weak, easily 
                <lb/>persuaded by those who have no right to interfere in his 
                <lb/>concerns, to adopt any measures which may facilitate 
                <lb/>their own interested views; but so tenacious of the 
                <lb/>prerogative delegated by the Creator to his creature 
                <lb/><emph style="font­-style: italic">man</emph>, that the opinions of a wife would be treated with 
                <lb/>scorn; her advice neglected, and her injunctions laugh-
                <lb break="no"/>ed at. But however <persName>Sarah</persName> may have erred heretofore 
                <lb/>in her conduct in regard to economy, and in not en-
                <lb break="no"/>deavoring to conceal her indifference towards him; 
                <lb/>she at least ever has practised, and will continue still, 
                <lb/>the needful virtue of PATIENCE. I say needful, be-
                <lb break="no"/>cause there is no passing through life with any degree 
                <lb/>of comfort without a pretty good share of it; and in 
                <lb/>the married state, I believe a double portion is abso-
                <lb break="no"/>lutely necessary. I cannot speak from experience, as 
                <lb/>I have never entered the holy pale, and being now on 
                <lb/>the wrong side of thirty-five, in all probability never shall, 
                <lb/>unless some spruce young ’squire of twenty-one, (I 
                <lb/>would not marry one older) very rich and gallant should

                HAVING had time to look about me, and get a lit-
                <lb break="no"/>tle settled, I have taken up my pen to tell you how I 
                <lb/>like my situation. I hardly know how to define my 
                <lb/>sentiments on the subject, but every thing is so much 
                <lb/>better than I think it ought to be, every circumstance 
                <lb/>considered; that I am not satisfied. I cannot feel easy 
                <lb/>under a weight of obligation, and I very much suspect 
                <lb/>that the Marquis is at the bottom of all the elegancies so 
                <lb/>profusely provided in this place. Not that I am so 
                <lb/>vain or romantically ridiculous, as to imagine he has any 
                <lb/>sinister designs, or that he means to take the trouble of 
                <lb/>visiting me in this retirement, and by appearing sudden-
                <lb break="no"/>ly before me when I thought him in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, surprise me 
                <lb/>into an appearance of something very far from indiffer-
                <lb break="no"/>ence. Though I am sensible this would be quite in the 
                <lb/>novel style, I believe such scenes very seldom take place 
                <lb/>in real life. But I think from some conversation which 
                <lb/>passed between <placeName>Frederick</placeName> and his Lordship, that his 
                <lb/>sensibility was hurt, by reflecting that he had made a 
                <lb/>virtuous woman the object of illicit pursuit, and he 
                <lb/>thought he never could make a sufficient reparation, for 
                <lb/>the persecution I had suffered. <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> does not 
                <lb/>see, or feel, as I do upon this subject; and it is a topic 
                <lb/>so delicate, that I cannot discuss it with him; I will 
                <lb/>therefore describe to you the circumstances which 
                <lb/>give me uneasiness, and request your advice in what 
                <lb/>manner to conduct myself. When we arrived at the 
                <lb/>inn, at <placeName>Warwick</placeName>, a servant in livery opened the chaise 
                <lb/>door, for which he had been evidently waiting, and 
                <lb/>having enquired if it was not the gentleman and lady 
                <lb/>going to <placeName>Woodland’s</placeName>, led the way to an apartment 
                <lb/>where the cloth was laid for supper; two wax can-
                <lb break="no"/>dles were burning on the table, and with marked re-
                <lb break="no"/>spect the young man informed <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> that his 
                <lb/>master had written to him to procure accommoda-
                <lb break="no"/>tions at the inn for that night, as he imagined the la-
                <lb break="no"/>dy would be too much fatigued to proceed to the man-
                <lb break="no"/>sion house without repose; then turning to me, he ask-
                <lb break="no"/>ed, if he should send the chambermaid that I might 
                <lb/>look at the chamber, for if I did not like it, I could 
                <lb/>have it changed. <persName>Darnley</persName> answered in the affirmative, 
                <lb/>and when the young man left the room, said, “this 
                <lb/>looks well, <persName>Sarah</persName>, it looks as if <persName>Sir Richard</persName> meant 
                <lb/>to have us respected.” To me it appeared more 
                <lb/>than well, for though I knew that a gentleman’s stew-
                <lb break="no"/>ard was always reckoned as a respectable situation 
                <lb/>in life, upon an equality with the better, and looked 
                <lb/>up to by the lower class of tenants residing on the es-
                <lb break="no"/>tate; yet it was not often that the owner of the estate 
                <lb/>interested himself in such trivial concerns as the com-
                <lb break="no"/>fort and convenience of the steward’s and his wife; 
                <lb/>travelling especially, when never having seen or known 
                <lb/>the family. As I made these reflections, it first oc-
                <lb break="no"/>curred to me, that <persName>Sir Richard Bourke</persName> was the os-
                <lb break="no"/>tensible employer, and the Marquis the directing 
                <lb/>hand, supplying all these superfluous attentions. Oh, 
                <lb/>vanity! <seg xml:id="a138" corresp="#n138">vanity! thy name is woman!</seg><note xml:id="n138" corresp="#a138"><term style="font-style: italic">Vanity!</term>: a common misquotation of <persName>Shakespeare’s</persName> “<quote>Frailty, thy name is woman</quote>” (<bibl style="font­-style: italic">Hamlet</bibl> 1.2.146).</note> said a wise man.  
                <lb/>Well, I acknowledge it is vain in me to suppose myself 
                <lb/>of so much consequence; but trust me, <persName>Ann</persName>, however 
                <lb/>the suggestion may flatter my self-love, it is too humbling 
                <lb/>to my pride, to occasion any very agreeable emotions; 
               <lb/>it is living in a state of perpetual obligation; and that 
                <lb/>of all others is to me the most painful.
              </p>
              <p>
                A plentiful and elegant supper, excellent wine, and 
                <lb/>the chat of the host who is a facetious man, of great 
                <lb/>information, concerning the families, &amp;c. of the gentle-
                <lb break="no"/>men and nobility, made the time pass very agreeably 
                <lb/>to <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>; but I felt myself somewhat fatigued 
                <lb/>and retired early. In the morning, while I was break-
                <lb break="no"/>fasting, the same young man who had spoken to us 
                <lb/>the night before, informed me, that <persName>Sir Richard</persName> had 
                <lb/>ordered the furniture to be removed from the large 
                <lb/>house, to the one <choice><orig>they</orig><reg>we</reg></choice> were to occupy; which I found 
                <lb/>was denominated <placeName>Woodland Cottage</placeName>; that he had in 
                <lb/>consequence of orders from the same quarter, engaged 
                <lb/>two female domestics, a cook and a chambermaid; 
                <lb/>but if on trial I did not approve them, he had only en-
                <lb break="no"/>gaged them for a month, and was to pay them their 
                <lb/>wages as soon as they had got others to supply their 
                <lb/>places. When breakfast was over, I expressed a de-
                <lb break="no"/>sire to go immediately to my new home, and in a few 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>moments, a very neat, plain travelling chariot, drew up 
                <lb/>to the door. “Why do we not go in the post chaise <persName>Mr 
                  <lb/>Darnley</persName>?” said I. “Because <persName>John</persName> informed me last 
                <lb/>night,” he replied, “that this chariot and pair, are al-
                <lb break="no"/>ways kept at Woodlands, and is for the use of the 
                <lb/>steward’s family.” “It is certainly superfluous,” said 
                <lb/>I, “a horse might have been necessary for you, but for 
                <lb/>my own part, I had rather walk at any time; besides, 
                <lb/>I do not want a carriage at another person’s expense.” 
                <lb/>“But if it is customary for the steward to have the 
                <lb/>use of this chariot, why should we be particular in re-
                <lb break="no"/>fusing such a convenience?” said he hastily. “<persName>John</persName> 
                <lb/>told me also,” he continued, “that he is to reside with 
                <lb/>us, and that <persName>Sir Richard</persName> had written to his agent in 
                <lb/><placeName>London</placeName>, to make arrangements with me concerning 
                <lb/>him there, for he hoped he should give satisfaction. I 
                <lb/>forgot to tell you it was mentioned to me the day be-
                <lb break="no"/>fore I left town, and that fifty <choice><orig>pound</orig><reg>pounds</reg></choice> a year is added 
                <lb/>to our income on that account, as it was necessary 
                <lb/>that I should have a man to go on messages, &amp;c. &amp;c.” 
                <lb/>I saw <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> was too well pleased in having so 
                <lb/>many conveniences to refuse one of them; so turned 
                <lb/>the conversation to the beauty of the country. It was 
                <lb/>a very fine morning, and you know even late in Octo-
                <lb break="no"/>ber, Autumn retains much of her beauty; the rich and 
                <lb/>glowing tints which variegate the woods, the short 
                <lb/>grass impearled by the exhalations which at this time of 
                <lb/>the year can hardly be denominated either dew or 
                <lb/>frost, <choice><orig>eradicated</orig><reg>irradiated</reg></choice> by a clear, mild, though distant sun, 
                <lb/>inspires the mind with sensations though perhaps not 
                <lb/>quite so cheerful; yet, in my opinion, more exquisitely de-
                <lb break="no"/>lightful, than the gay exuberance of flaunting Spring. 
                <lb/>On our arrival at the mansion prepared for us, its neat 
                <lb/>and retired situation struck me very pleasantly. The 
                <lb/>woodbine and jessamine, which almost covered the 
                <lb/>front, had not entirely faded, as the house has a south 
                <lb/>aspect; the garden is laid out with simplicity and 
                <lb/>taste; and the part appropriated to kitchen purposes, 
                <lb/>contained every thing useful; a large asparagus bed, 
                <lb/>plenty of artichokes, and some excellent wall fruit trees. 
                <lb/>The interior of the house is by far too expensively fur-
                <lb break="no"/>nished; all of which appear to me to be entirely new. 
                <lb/>A breakfast parlour with cottage chairs, <seg xml:id="a139" corresp="#n139">pembroke and

                <lb/>near the house, and a poultry yard, well stocked, 
                <lb/>completed the whole of the possessions of which it 
                <lb/>seems I am instituted mistress. There is but one cir-
                <lb break="no"/>cumstance which in the least reconciles me to accept-
                <lb break="no"/>ing these accommodations—which is a note which was 
                <lb/>laid on a table in the chamber, which I had selected 
                <lb/>for myself; when I retired for the night, and which 
                <lb/>the chambermaid told me <persName>John</persName> had desired her to lay 
                <lb/>there. It was from <persName>Lady Bourke</persName>, and the following is 
                <lb/>a copy.

            IT appears from a number of letters which passed 
            <lb/>between <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> and her friend, that she contin-
            <lb break="no"/>ued to reside at <placeName>Woodland Cottage</placeName> for a period of sev-
            <lb break="no"/>en or eight years; but as these letters contained no 
            <lb/>material incidents, it was thought better to suppress 
            <lb/>them, giving only an abstract of any occurrence of con-
            <lb break="no"/>sequence for the reader to know, in order to the better 
            <lb/>understanding the subsequent letters.
          </p>
          <p>
            <persName>Mrs. Darnley’s</persName> father returned from <placeName>India</placeName> with a 
            <lb/>broken constitution, and but very little richer than 
            <lb/>when he left <placeName>England</placeName>. His affectionate daughter pro-
            <lb break="no"/>cured him apartments in a farm house so near that she 
            <lb/>could herself attend to his comfort; but this was an un-
            <lb break="no"/>fortunate circumstance for her. <persName>Mr. Osborne</persName> was a 
            <lb/>man of loose morals, and dissipated habits, and neither 
            <lb/>distress, or ill health, had in the least amended those 
            <lb/>defects. Though he could no longer practise the vices 
            <lb/>which he had ever indulged in without restraint, yet it 
            <lb/>seemed his chief pleasure to retrace scenes of past ri-
            <lb break="no"/>ot and debauchery; and his conversation was in gen-
            <lb break="no"/>eral such that no delicate woman could wish to remain 
            <lb/>long in his company. Unhappily, this was a compan-
            <lb break="no"/>ion too congenial to the mind of <persName>Darnley</persName>, for him to a-
            <lb break="no"/>void the contagion which such a character spreads a-
            <lb break="no"/>round, and which, like the spotted pestilence, lays all 
            <lb/>waste and desolate. Peace, Virtue, Honour, fall sa-
            <lb break="no"/>crifices to its malignant influence. The voice of con-
            <lb break="no"/>science is silenced, Religion totally neglected, and the 
            <lb/>most shocking depravity pervades the whole system. 
            <lb/>Though <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> was too delicate to make many 
            <lb/>complaints, of the irregular conduct of two persons with 
            <lb/>whom she was so nearly connected, yet her friend <persName>Ann</persName>, 
            <lb/>who frequently visited her, delivered her sentiments 
            <lb/>very freely upon the subject in her letters to <persName>Elinor</persName>. 
            <lb/>An extract from one of these, which appears to have 
            <lb/>been written in the third year of <persName>Sarah’s</persName> residence at 
            <lb/><placeName>Woodlands</placeName>, is particularly interesting, and therefore it 
            <lb/>is given here.

                            “I have, since I have been with my dear <persName>Sarah</persName>, this 
                            <lb/>autumn, found her particularly gloomy and depressed. 
                            <lb/>The cause is evident, and needs no explanation. <persName>Darn-
                              <lb break="no"/>ley’s</persName> circumstances are again embarrassed, and it is 
                            <lb/>with the utmost difficulty she can obtain from him 
                            <lb/>money for housekeeping; and whenever necessity o-
                            <lb break="no"/>bliges her to make a demand, he flies into such pas-
                            <lb break="no"/>sions, that terrified, she will submit to every difficulty<choice><orig>;</orig><reg>,</reg></choice>

                            <Lb break="no"/>est credit, and who must necessarily repay their cour-
                            <lb break="no"/>tesy by advancing the price, and thus by the demands 
                            <lb/>being larger than he had expected, he seems to think 
                            <lb/>he has reason on his side, when he scolds and complains 
                            <lb/>at what he chooses to term extravagance. And here I 
                            <lb/>must digress to remark, that in my opinion, the state 
                            <lb/>of total dependence in which women in general are, 
                            <lb/>must tend to weaken that affection, that confidence, 
                            <lb/>which should subsist between married persons. I can-
                            <lb break="no"/>not imagine domestick happiness would be greatly en-
                            <lb break="no"/>creased, were wives released from that solicitude and 
                            <lb/>anxiety which every woman of sensibility must feel, 
                            <lb/>who is obliged to apply to her husband for every shil-
                            <lb break="no"/>ling she expends; a man who does not provide, that is, 
                            <lb/>make the purchases necessary for his family, but simply 
                            <lb/>commissions his wife to do it, is very ill able to judge 
                            <lb/>how much money is requisite for the daily expenditure; 
                            <lb/>and will content himself with merely calculating the 
                            <lb/>great and most obvious articles, totally overlooking 
                            <lb/>the thousand little <choice><orig>minute</orig><reg>minutia</reg></choice> which, though they make no 
                            <lb/><emph style="font­-style: italic">show</emph>, cost nearly as much in the course of a year, as things 
                            <lb/>apparently of greater consequence. But to return to 
                            <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName>. She appeared to reap much satisfaction from 
                            <lb/>my visit; for she is a good part of the time alone. As 
                            <lb/>her father and <persName>Darnley</persName> go frequently to <placeName>Warwick</placeName> and 
                            <cb/>
                            <lb/>stay several days together, I asked her if he had long 
                            <lb/>accustomed himself to be thus estranged from home. 
                            <lb/>She answered with a sigh, “Yes, that she did not pos-

                            <lb/>to confess a truth, were it not for his reputation’s sake, 
                            <lb/>which suffered from the company he associated with, 
                            <lb/>she was happier when he was away, than when he was 
                            <lb/>at home.” “We were not made,” said she, “to constitute 
                            <lb/>each other’s happiness; our minds, our habits, our pur-
                            <lb break="no"/>suits are totally dissimilar, and though we are chained

                            <lb/>one evening as we were walking out; we had gone far-
                            <lb break="no"/>ther from home than we had intended, and a shower 
                            <lb/>beginning to fall pretty briskly, we looked around for 
                            <lb/>some place of shelter, where we might stop until the 
                            <lb/>rain ceased, or send home for a carriage. A neat 
                            <lb/>looking cottage presented itself, almost hid in a tuft of 
                            <lb/>willow trees; we hastened in, but the interior of the 
                            <lb/>habitation did not agree with the appearance of com-
                            <lb break="no"/>fort the outside had denoted. Every thing was mean 
                            <lb/>and dirty; six or eight dirty ragged children were play-
                            <lb break="no"/>ing in the room, which seemed to answer for parlour, 
                            <lb/>dining room, and kitchen, all in one; a miserable look-
                            <lb break="no"/>ing woman was nursing one child about eight months 
                            <lb/>old, and another apparently of the same age, was cry-
                            <lb break="no"/>ing in an old, offensively filthy cradle. “You have a 
                            <lb/>large family,” said <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, when asking leave 
                            <lb/>to remain a few moments, she seated herself on one of 
                            <lb/>the miserable stools which helped to furnish the apart-
                            <lb break="no"/>ment. “Aye, Heaven help me,” said the woman, 
                            <lb/>“more than is good, I don’t know what is to become of 
                            <lb/>us all next winter.” “Where is your husband, good 
                            <lb/>woman?” said I, “has he no trade, or can he get no 
                            <lb/>employ?” “He work, Lord bless me! I should think 
                            <lb/>the bread would choak him that he earnt; no! no! 
                            <lb/><persName>John</persName> can spend money fast enough, but he don’t like 
                            <lb/>the trouble of working for it.” “Are those children 
                            <lb/>twins?” asked <persName>Sarah</persName>. “No,” she replied, petulantly, 
                            <lb/>“one is a little cross bastard, that is no child of mine.” 
                            <lb/>“A nurse child?” “Yes, it was put here to nurse 
                            <lb/>thirteen months ago, but I never saw the colour of the 
                            <lb/>woman’s money since she brought it, and now she is 
                            <lb/>gone nobody knows where. To be sure, I should have 
                            <lb/>sent it to the parish long ago, but <persName>Mr. Steward</persName> there, 
                            <lb/>that lives at the cottage near the great house, came 
                            <lb/>when I lived two miles off at the hut on the green, and 
                            <lb/>gave me three guineas, and told me I might come and 
                            <lb/>live in this house for nothing; so I came, and folks do 
                            <lb/>say, if every one took care of their own, he ought to 
                            <lb/>maintain the brat.”—She was going on, but I perceived 
                            <lb/>that <persName>Sarah</persName> changed colour; first crimson red, then ash-
                            <lb break="no"/>ly pale, then red again; therefore interrupted the wo-
                            <lb break="no"/>man’s loquacity; but <persName>Sarah</persName> had heard enough to awak-
                            <lb break="no"/>en curiosity.—“Whom do you mean?” said she, “by 
                            <lb/><persName>Mr. Steward</persName>?” “Why, Mr. What’s-his-name there, <persName>Sir 
                              <lb/>Richard’s</persName> <persName>Steward</persName>; he brought a fine Madam they 
                            <lb/>say, from <placeName>Warwich</placeName>, and she and an old woman lived 
                            <lb/>three or four months in this here house, and here this 
                            <lb/>boy was born, and here she stayed until she was tired of 
                            <lb/>him, or he of her, and so she went off; I wish she had 
                            <lb/>taken her brat with her.”

                <persName>MRS. DARNLEY</persName> could not support herself; and 
                <lb/>though it continued to rain, she arose, walked toward 
                <lb/>the window to hide her emotions, and proposed going. 
                <lb/>I did not attempt to prevail on her to stay, for I was sensible 
                <lb/>her being drenched through with rain would not to her be 
                <lb/>more dangerous or painful, than to endure the conversa-
                <lb break="no"/>tion of this woman. She hurried home without speak-
                <lb break="no"/>ing, and went immediately to her own apartment, only 
                <lb/>saying as she passed up stairs, “<persName>Ann</persName>, change your 
                <lb/>clothes immediately, and have a glass of wine.” “Will 
                <lb/>you do the same, my dear <persName>Sarah</persName>?” said I. She replied, 
                <lb/>“yes, certainly,” and I saw her no more until supper 
                <lb/>time. <persName>Darnley</persName> was in the room when I went down; he was 
                <lb/>lolling on a sofa, and whistling in a thoughtless, unconcern-
                <lb break="no"/>ed manner. He had just enquired for his wife; when, 
                <lb/>hearing her foot on the stairs, he started upon his feet, 
                <lb/>and going to the door to meet her, said peevishly, 
                <lb/>“Where the devil have you been all this evening? it is 
                <lb/>half an hour since you were called to supper, and it is 
                <lb/>quite cold.”—“I came as quick as I could,” said she, 
                <lb/>coldly, and taking her seat, helped me to a bit of chick-
                <lb break="no"/>en.—“You have been walking,” said he, addressing 
                <lb/>himself to me.—“Yes, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> and myself have 
                <lb/>been finely wet.” “That was unlucky.”—“It may 
                <lb/>be unlucky,” said <persName>Sarah</persName>, gravely, “as far as it con-
                <lb break="no"/>cerns ourselves, but I trust it will prove most lucky to 
                <lb/>a helpless, unprotected being, who, but for this shower, 
                <lb/>I should never perhaps have known was in existence.” 
                <lb/>“Come, none of your charity sermons,” said he.—“I 
                <lb/>am not wishing to excite compassion, but awaken jus-
                <lb break="no"/>tice, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>. I must beg a candid, unequivocal 
                <lb/>answer to a question I am about to ask.”  “Well, ask 
                <lb/>your question, and then I will choose whether I will an-
                <lb break="no"/>swer it or not.”—“Do you know any thing concerning 
                <lb/>a child put to nurse with the woman who lives at the 
                <lb/>white cottage?” “What is that to you?” said he has-
                <lb break="no"/>tily; but his face crimsoned as he spoke, and his lips 
                <lb/>quivered.—“Do not put yourself in a passion, <persName>George</persName>,” 
                <lb/>said she calmly, “I do not mean to have any disagree-
                <lb break="no"/>ment about it; the child is neglected, and will either 
                <lb/>perish in its infancy, or grow up to be a burthen to it-
                <lb break="no"/>self and a nuisance to society, unless those whose duty 
                <lb/>it is to provide for its maintenance and education, 
                <lb/>snatch it from so deplorable a fate. I ask no questions, 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>I will not trouble you to make an excuse; if the child 
                <lb/>owes its being to you, give orders that it be brought 
                <lb/>home, and I will see it is properly taken care of; but let 
                <lb/>me entreat you not to add to the offence already com-
                <lb break="no"/>mitted against religion and morality, the unpardonable 
                <lb/>one of leaving your offspring to perish.” D—n-t—n,” 
                <lb/>said he, throwing down his knife and fork, “of all the 
                <lb/>plagues a man can have, a moralizing, sentimental, 
                <lb/>canting, hypocritical wife, is the worst.—What the 
                <lb/>devil business had you to be prying into matters that 
                <lb/>did not concern you? Such troublesome, curious, jeal-
                <lb break="no"/>ous women are the torment of men’s lives.” “Will 
                <lb/>you send the child home?” said she, endeavouring at 
                <lb/>composure. “You may take the child, and its moth-
                <lb break="no"/>er, and the nurse, and all her dirty brats, and all go to 
                <lb/>—together, so as I hear nothing more of you.”—
                <lb/>“Grant me patience, Heaven!” said she, rising hastily 
                <lb/>from table, and rushing out of the room. When, will you be-
                <lb break="no"/>lieve it? He rang the bell very deliberately, and with 
                <lb/>the most perfect appearance of composure, bade the 
                <lb/>servant clear the table; then turning to me, said, as 
                <lb/><persName>Sarah</persName> is so indisposed, I will not disturb her to night; 
                <lb/>perhaps you will like to take my place; then bidding 
                <lb/>the servant order a bed in one of the spare rooms to be 
                <lb/>got ready for him, he bade me good night.—How my 
                <lb/>dear <persName>Sarah</persName> spent the night, may be easily imagined—
                <lb/>however, in the morning she gave orders for the child 
                <lb/>to be brought home; appointed a room as much out of 
                <lb/>the way as possible for a nursery, and hired a woman 
                <lb/>to take care of it.

                Sometime after this, <persName>Mrs. Darnley’s</persName> father paid the 
                <lb/>debt of nature; her husband, from gaming, extrava-
                <lb break="no"/>gance, and folly of different kinds, offended his em-
                <lb break="no"/>ployer, and was dismissed from his situation. The 
                <lb/>Marquis was dead, and though he left to <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>a bequest of one hundred and fifty pounds a year, dur-
                <lb break="no"/>ing her life, yet that was trifling compared to what 
                <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName> had been accustomed to expend. They re-
                <lb break="no"/>moved to <placeName>Wales</placeName>, and here her brother <persName>Frederic Lewis</persName> 
                <lb/>visited her. During this period, she was deprived of 
                <lb/>her friend <persName>Ann</persName>, and her mind became, to use her own 
                <lb/>expression, in a letter she addressed to her brother, 
                <lb/>“dead to love and joy,” and alive only to a sensation 
                <lb/>of peace which arose from a conviction of having, to 
                <lb/>the utmost, performed her duty. She was now at an 
                <lb/>age when every impulse of the soul is in full vigour, es-
                <lb break="no"/>pecially, in a well regulated mind; for the senses at 
                <lb/>this time are more under the controul of reason; the 
                <lb/>heart selects its associates and pleasures with caution, 
                <lb/>and its choice is sanctioned by judgment.—But <persName>Sarah</persName>, 
                <lb/>with a mind formed for all the gentle delights of love, 
                <lb/>friendship, and domestic happiness, had not one object 
                <lb/>on which to lavish its tenderness. A short letter which 
                <lb/>she addressed to her brother on his return from a six 
                <lb/>years station in <placeName>America</placeName>, from whence he had brought 
                <lb/>an amiable wife and two lovely children, will give a bet-
                <lb break="no"/>ter picture of her mind, situation and feelings, than any 
                <lb/>transcript could possibly do.

                YOU are returned to your native land, my dearest 
                <lb/>brother, and have brought with you love and peace: Heaven 
                <lb/>grant they may long, very long, be the inmates of

                Many are the changes that have taken place, since 
                <lb/>last we met. Am I happier? you ask—perhaps I may 
                <lb/>be thought so—perhaps I am so, if absence of pain is 
                <lb/>pleasure; then the torpid state into which my heart is 
                <lb/>fallen is happiness.—I have suffered much, my brother, 
                <lb/>but my sufferings are ended. I seldom weep now—
                <lb/>but then I as seldom smile; and my heart, which once 
                <lb/>would bound and flutter with indescribable sensation, 
                <lb/>now in dull and monotonous pulsations, receives and dis-
                <lb break="no"/>charges the vital fluid in slow, unvaried measure. <persName>Fred-
                  <lb break="no"/>eric</persName>, this is not happiness. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My father rests in the house appointed for all living. 
                <lb/>Here was a link dissolved in the great chain of my ex-
                <lb break="no"/>istence; but, though I felt the dissolution of so near a 
                <lb/>connexion awfully impressive, I could not regret one, 
                <lb/>whom I had never (since reason had the power to di-
                <lb break="no"/>rect my judgment,) respected; whom I had long ceas-
                <lb break="no"/>ed to love. Oh! that parents would consider the 
                <lb/>consequences of setting bad examples to their children. 
                <lb/>You, my dear brother, have been as deeply wounded 
                <lb/>by the errors of the departed, as I have; and had 
                <lb/>you lived at home as much as I did, I greatly 
                <lb/>fear your principles would have been perverted, 
                <lb/>by the scenes which would unavoidably have passed 
                <lb/>beneath your observation. I was saved from so dread-
                <lb break="no"/>ful a misfortune, by my good aunt; she was austere 
                <lb/>in her manners, severe in her temper, and scrupu-
                <lb break="no"/>lously particular in her opinions of female manners, and 
                <lb/>religious duty; but yet it is that aunt, unkind as in 
                <lb/>early life I used to think her, to whom I owe all that I 
                <lb/>ever knew of happiness. But this is a subject ungrate-
                <lb break="no"/>ful to us both; I will drop it when I have made one re-
                <lb break="no"/>mark.—You are now a parent, <persName>Frederic</persName>, and do not, 
                <lb/>I conjure you, forget that you are not only answerable 
                <lb/>to your Maker for your own conduct, but for the ex-
                <lb break="no"/>ample you set your children; for it is more than pro-
                <lb break="no"/>bable, that their eternal, as well as temporal happi-
                <lb break="no"/>ness will originate in you. Precept, my brother, will 
                <lb/>do nothing, unless backed by example; and what par-
                <lb break="no"/>ent can hope or think, a child will be benefitted by 
                <lb/>correction, given by one who knows not how to correct 
                <lb/>himself.

              <p>
                The last time my heart felt acutely, was in the loss 
                <lb/>of my valued <persName>Ann</persName>.—I had a friend—Yes, that is an 
                <lb/>inexhaustible source; the tears still gush forth when I 
                <lb/>remember I have a friend no longer.—You will say, 
                <lb/>you are my friend.—I know you are, as much as any 
                <lb/>man can be the friend of a sister, when he has a wife 
                <lb/>and children whom he loves sincerely, ardently, and 
                <lb/>who deserve to be so beloved. Connubial love! do-
                <lb break="no"/>mestic felicity! are ye then realities? alas, to me, ye 
                <lb/>have been like fairy tales, credited indeed in youth, 
                <lb/>but never experienced in any part of life. You en-
                <lb break="no"/>quire concerning our finances; we are neither rich nor 
                <lb/>poor; our circumstances are in unison with my feel-
                <lb break="no"/>ings; no luxuries to enjoy, no pressing wants to la-
                <lb break="no"/>ment. What you heard of the Marquis’s legacy is 
                <lb/>true; in addition to which, Darnley has employment 
                <lb/>in the warehouse of a manufacturing company, to re-
                <lb break="no"/>ceive orders, and note them in a day book; for this he 
                <lb/>receives a stipend of sixty pounds per annum. We 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>occupy a very small house, more like a cottage than 
                <lb/>any thing else, about half a mile from the town; our 
                <lb/>whole establishment consists of one girl to do the 
                <lb/>drudgery, my little <persName>Charles</persName>, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>, and myself. 
                <lb/>Could you come and see me, methinks my heart would 
                <lb/>once more beat with pleasure, and would fortune per-
                <lb break="no"/>mit me to embrace the wife of your choice, and your 
                <lb/>dear children, I should say, I knew what happiness 
                <lb/>was.

                      “You are pleased with our situation, and with 
                      <lb/>the little society that surrounds us. I am glad you 
                      <lb/>are; I do not wonder at the approbation you express 
                      <lb/>of the manners, conversation, and general character of 
                      <lb/>our good curate, <persName>Mr. Hayley</persName>.—He is all that man 
                      <lb/>ought to be; and since his residence among us, it 
                      <lb/>seems as though I felt awakened to the joys of society. 
                      <lb/>My brother, let my heart stand open to your view; I 
                      <lb/>feel, had such a man been presented to my notice in 
                      <lb/>early life, I should have experienced a different senti-
                      <lb break="no"/>ment to what I have ever yet known.—Perhaps I do 
                      <lb/>not properly comprehend what love is; at least such as 
                      <lb/>the visionaries of romance describe it; I never yet saw 
                      <lb/>the man who could make me defy the opinion of the 
                      <lb/>world, slight the moral duties, and forget the respect 
                      <lb/>due to myself.—But methinks for such a man as <persName>Hay-
                        <lb break="no"/>ley</persName>, I could suffer every temporal inconvenience—
                      <lb/>bear poverty, contempt, reproach.—Yes, all reproaches 
                      <lb/>but those of my own heart; but thinking him, as I do the 
                      <lb/>first of human beings, I could never commit any action 
                      <lb/>that would sink me in his esteem, or expose him to the 
                      <lb/>contempt of the world. I ever thought, and am now 
                      <lb/>more fully convinced, that the woman who experiences 
                      <lb/>the sentiment which alone is deserving the name of 
                      <lb/>love in all its purity, can never be guilty of aught that 
                      <lb/>would call a blush to her own cheek, or brand the ob-
                      <lb break="no"/>ject of her esteem with infamy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I am not hypocrite sufficient to offer an apology for 
                      <lb/>the candid avowal of my sentiments in regard to <persName>Mr. 
                        <lb/>Hayley</persName>.—They are not the impulse of a momentary 
                      <lb/>passion, they are the result of reason and observation. 
                      <lb/>I feel that his esteem is necessary to my peace of mind, 
                      <lb/>and to obtain that esteem is so desirable an object, that 
                      <lb/>it has aroused the sleeping faculties of my soul, and 
                      <lb/>called them into action. I have now some pleasurable 
                      <lb/>object in view; I pursue some daily amusement; I ex-
                      <lb break="no"/>ecute some little work of taste, or fancy; I practise a 
                      <lb/>new air upon my guitar, or from my window sketch 
                      <lb/>the outline of a landscape, or a group of sportive 
                      <lb/>children, and have the hope of receiving approbation 
                      <lb/>from one of whose judgment I have the highest opin-
                      <lb break="no"/>ion, and who I know, if he cannot praise with truth, 
                      <lb/>will remain silent.—I offer no apology. No, why should 
                      <lb/>I?—You require none, acquainted as you are with my 
                      <lb/>strong sense of moral rectitude, of my full persuasion 
                      <lb/>of a superintending Deity, and the certain rewards 
                      <lb/>and punishments that await us in a future state, you 
                      <lb/>cannot believe me depraved.—Knowing as you do the 
                      <lb/>character of the person I esteem, you will dismiss all 
                      <lb/>fear.—But mistake me not, it is neither affection to my 
                      <lb/>husband, nor the dread of the world’s censure, binds 
                      <lb/>me to <persName>Darnley</persName>.—No, every moral tie he has himself 
                      <lb/>voluntarily and repeatedly broken; but I have never 
                      <lb/>yet infringed my duty, I am his wife.—Love him, alas! 
                      <lb/>I never did! never can.—Though had he taken the 
                      <lb/>proper means to conciliate tenderness, my heart would 
                      <lb/>have soon become his own; it was formed for unbounded 
                      <lb/>tenderness, but its impulses never expanded; they were 
                      <lb/>repelled by unkindness, and shrunk again within itself; 
                      <lb/>safe in my own keeping, and my obedience to his wish-
                      <lb break="no"/>es has ever been undeviating. But if I have found a 
                      <lb/>source of happiness, which religion and honour does not 
                      <lb/>disallow, why should I reject it, for one, who never stu-
                      <lb break="no"/>died my peace, but made self gratification his sole ob-
                      <lb break="no"/>ject? Ah, my brother, if I am to be a stranger to 
                      <lb/>pleasure, till my ideas of it are in unison with his, I 
                      <lb/>shall remain unacquainted with it forever.”

  <head style="text-align:center">RE-PUBLICATION OF
    <lb/><bibl>SINCERITY, A NOVEL—IN A SERIES OF LETTERS</bibl>.
    <lb/>BY A LADY OF <placeName>MASSACHUSETTS</placeName>.</head>
          </p>
          <p>
            IN the first volume of our Magazine was commenc-
            <lb break="no"/>ed the publication of an <hi rend="italic">original novel</hi>, entitled, “<bibl>SIN-
              <lb break="no"/>CERITY</bibl>,” which has been continued weekly to the pre-
            <lb break="no"/>sent time. But as a very large number of our present 
            <lb/>patrons were not subscribers to the first volume, and 
            <lb/>consequently are not in possession of the former part of 
            <lb/>the above work, it is our intention, in order to accom-
            <lb break="no"/>modate those who may be desirous of perusing the 
            <lb/>whole, to reprint, as speedily as possible, this moral 
            <lb/>and interesting little novel in a volume by itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            That by far the greater part of this species of ficti-
            <lb break="no"/>tious history, now in circulation, is injurious to the 
            <lb/>manners, and subversive of the morals of youth, is a 
            <lb/>truth, which many lament, and which none will deny. 
            <lb/>But the pleasure with which they are read, and the 
            <lb/>eagerness with which they are sought after, will ever 
            <lb/>baffle the most sedulous attempts of parents and in-
            <lb break="no"/>structors, to keep them out of the hands of those, who 
            <lb/>are placed under their care. The best, and indeed the 
            <lb/>only remedy for this growing evil, is, the introduction of 
            <lb/>publications, of the NOVEL class, which are unexcep-
            <lb break="no"/>tionable in their moral tendency, and calculated to im-
            <lb break="no"/>press, on the young and tender mind, sentiments of 
            <lb/>honour, of virtue, and of religion; to represent things 
            <lb/>as they are; not as the wild imagination paints them; 
            <lb/>to teach lessons of prudence, how to avoid and to bear 
            <lb/>misfortunes, instead of enhancing them, by exhibiting 
            <lb/>to the inexperienced and unsuspecting mind, delight-
            <lb break="no"/>ful, fairy prospects, which are never to be realized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of this kind is the little work, which we now take 
            <lb/>the liberty of introducing to the notice of an enlighten-
            <lb break="no"/>ed public. It is presumed, that no objections can be 
            <lb/>made to it, on the score of its morality, or the impres-
            <lb break="no"/>sion it is calculated to produce on the mind and man-
            <lb break="no"/>ners. Virtue is represented, in all her native simplici-
            <lb break="no"/>ty and beauty; and Vice,
            <lb/><hi rend="italic">“<quote>A monster of so frightful mien,
              <lb/>“As, to be hated, needs but to be seen,</quote>”</hi>
            <lb/>is exhibited in her own proper ugliness and deformity. 
            <lb/>The story is far from being improbable. It is interest-
            <lb break="no"/>ing, abounds with incident, and yet is not spun out to 
            <lb/>that tedious length, which, in many novels, wearies the 
            <lb/>reader, and consumes that time, which might be devo-
            <lb/>ted to more valuable pursuits.

                 MY Brother, the world and I have done with each 
                 <lb/>other; the grave yawns, I stand shivering on its brink, 
                 <lb/>and whispering spirits seem to say, “a moment more, 
                 <lb/>and you will burst through the veil of mortality, and 
                 <lb/>stand in the presence of the Eternal.” I have surveyed 
                 <lb/>my past life, and what does it appear? a vast blank, 
                 <lb/>on which my history may be written in one expressive 
                 <lb/>word, <term style="font-style: italic"><choice><orig>dissappointment</orig><reg>disappointment</reg></choice></term>. I have lived for others, lost to 
                 <lb/>myself. In the early part of my life, the friendship of 
                 <lb/><persName>Ann</persName> was a firm rock on which I could rest secure even 
                 <lb/>though the dashing tempests of calumny and persecu-
                 <lb break="no"/>tion, threatened to whelm my devoted bark.—She pas-
                 <lb break="no"/>sed to her place of rest, and the ice of indifference be-
                 <lb break="no"/>numbed with its petrifying power, every sensation of 
                 <lb/>my soul. <choice><orig>Seperated</orig><reg>Separated</reg></choice> from every being with whom I 
                 <lb/>could hold communion; thrown among strangers at a 
                 <lb/>period of life, when, though the sensibility is supposed 
                 <lb/>not to be so impetuous as in youth, yet when called in-
                 <lb break="no"/>to action by merit, and sanctioned by reason, it is more 
                 <lb/>lasting, more powerful; and being divested of passion, 
                 <lb/>becomes at once a source of delight, and an encitement 
                 <lb/>to all that is laudable and praise  worthy.—Thus situa-
                 <lb break="no"/>ted, with discernment to discover, and judgment to 
                 <lb/>appreciate sterling worth, wherever I found it, I be-
                 <lb break="no"/>came acquainted with <persName>Mr. Hayley</persName>. Our intercourse 
                 <lb/>gradually grew into intimacy, and that intimacy ripen-
                 <lb break="no"/>ed into a strong and lasting friendship; from that time 
                 <lb/>the colour of my fate became more cheerful, and I can-
                 <lb break="no"/>not describe to you the pleasure that pervaded my 
                 <lb/>mind when I discovered, there was one worthy being in 
                 <lb/>the world to whom my peace, my reputation, my wel-
                 <lb break="no"/>fare was of consequence. I was naturally of a social 
                 <lb/>communicative disposition; but after the experience I 
                 <lb/>have had of the duplicity, weakness, and wickedness of 
                 <lb/>the world, is it surprising, that while I mixed in the 
                 <lb/>circle of visitors which comprised the society of my 
                 <lb/>place of residence, I shrunk from every advance to con-
                 <lb break="no"/>fidential intimacy with any. Of my own sex, I have sel-
                 <lb break="no"/>dom met with any who are formed for more than the 
                 <lb/>companion of an hour.—Your sex, in general, accustom 
                 <lb/>themselves to consider women in so inferiour a light, 
                 <lb/>that they oftener treat us like children and playthings, 
                 <lb/>than intelligent beings. I must be candid enough to 
                 <lb/>confess, it is too frequently our own fault, that we are 
                 <lb/>not held in higher estimation.—How gratifying, then, 
                 <lb/>was it to my self love, to be considered by a man of 
                 <lb/>sense and erudition as an equal, and to be conversed with 
                 <lb/>as a rational companion.—I recapitulate these par-
                 <lb break="no"/>ticulars, to let you see, my brother, I am not pas-
                 <lb break="no"/>sing out of life, without having had, during my last 
                 <lb/>years, some bright gleams of sunshine, which gave me 
                 <lb/>a full conviction that happiness was attainable in this 
                 <lb/>world; though it was placed beyond my grasp.—When 
                 <lb/>I first married, had we each pursued a different course to 
                 <lb/>what we unfortunately took, we might have come very 
                 <lb/>near happiness, at least, as near as any one can ap-
                 <lb break="no"/>proach it in a married state, whose heart is silent 
                 <lb/>to the language of affection; but my soul refused to 
                 <lb/>commune with a sensualist, and where love really ex-
                 <lb break="no"/>ists it requires so many delicate attentions, such a de-
                 <lb break="no"/>cency of manner, purity of language, and cleanliness of 
                 <lb/>person, to keep it alive after so near a connection has 
                 <lb/>taken place; that where all those circumstances are 
                 <lb/>entirely neglected, or the direct contrary practised, it could 
                 <lb/>never be expected to arise in a heart where it had never 
                 <lb/>the smallest previous admission. Want of confidence in 
                 <lb/>a husband, is death to the affection of a wife, and she who 
                 <lb/>is by turns the slave of capricious passion, or the object of 
                 <lb/>contempt or neglect, if she is possessed of the least 
                 <lb/>degree of delicacy and feeling, must suffer a bon-
                 <lb break="no"/>dage more severe, than the slave who is chained to the 
                 <lb/>oar.</p>
               <p>
                 I think, my good and dear Frederic, that this will be 
                 <lb/>the last letter I shall ever write you. My health has 
                 <lb/>been declining for several months. My strength fails 
                 <lb/>daily, and it has cost me many trials to write this. I 
                 <lb/>wish you could come and see me before I go hence; 
                 <lb/>but the distance is great, and I know your finances are 
                 <lb/>bounded.—I pray you, my brother, keep up a correspon-
                 <cb/>
                 <lb break="no"/>dence with <persName>Mr. Hayley</persName>; should you not be able to 
                 <lb/>visit me; he will communicate to you the tidings of my 
                 <lb/>departure.—I have said much to him concerning 
                 <lb/><persName>Charles</persName>.—I know he will have a watchful eye upon 
                 <lb/>him, and ever be his friend and counsellor; I have 
                 <lb/>nought to leave him, poor lad, but my blessing; and 
                 <lb/>yet methinks I bequeath him an invaluable treasure in 
                 <lb/>giving him such a <seg xml:id="a149" corresp="#n149">friend.</seg><note xml:id="n149" corresp="#a149">The remaining sentences of this letter were removed from the later novel version.</note>—I believe—I have been told
                 <lb/>—I think it is more than probable—that <persName>Mr. Hayley</persName> 
                 <lb/>will soon be married; may the partner he shall select 
                 <lb/>have every virtue, every grace, every winning accom-
                 <lb break="no"/>plishment; may she have a heart capable of estimating 
                 <lb/>as she ought the supreme felicity of her lot, and may 
                 <lb/>every blessing Heaven can bestow or they desire, be 
                 <lb/>their portion.—But oh! my brother, I wish not, indeed, 
                 <lb/>I wish not, to live to see it.—Forgive me—a tear 
                 <lb/>has fallen upon the paper; let it expiate my offence (if 
                 <lb/>it is one to love and reverence virtue almost to adora-

                I THOUGHT when I concluded my last to you, dear 
                <lb/><persName>Frederic</persName>, that I never again should resume my pen: the 
                <lb/>languid flame of life but faintly glimmered, and it seem-
                <lb break="no"/>ed as though the smallest breath, from the fiend ad-
                <lb break="no"/>versity, must have extinguished it forever.—But the 
                <lb/>human heart is not so easily broken as is in general be-
                <lb break="no"/>lieved; oft may it be lacerated until it bleeds to its very 
                <lb/>quick; oft may it be wrung, until every fibre cracks, and 
                <lb/>yet it will beat and supply the vital stream that nour-
                <cb/>
                <lb break="no"/>ishes existence.—A circumstance has taken place, my 
                <lb/>brother, which, even in health, I should have dreaded 
                <lb/>to encounter, yet my weak frame sunk not under it, 
                <lb/>and I have acted, I hope, as a christian should. It is 
                <lb/>about ten days since, that <persName>Mr. Hayley</persName> called on me in 
                <lb/>the morning, and asked me if I was adequate to taking 
                <lb/>a short ride and making a charitable visit.—This, in 
                <lb/>fine weather, he has frequently done, since my en-
                <lb break="no"/>creased debility, always taking care to hold out some 
                <lb/>object, the pursuit of which might engage me to take 
                <lb/>the exercise, though the languor of my strength and 
                <lb/>spirits might lead me to decline exertion.
              </p>
              <p>
                I felt uncommonly cheerful that morning, and <persName>Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName> seconding his entreaty, I complied. When <persName>Mr. Hay-
                    <lb break="no"/>ley</persName> and myself were seated in the chaise, he told me 
                <lb/>there was an old woman in the <choice><orig>neighbourhood</orig><reg>neighborhood</reg></choice> of our 
                <lb/>village, who had been very ill of a fever; that when 
                <lb/>her life was despaired of, he had been sent for to pray 
                <lb/>with her; that on visiting her, he found her delirious, 
                <lb/>and that she had several times called on my name in 
                <lb/>such a manner, as led him to suppose she had injured 
                <lb/>me.—Upon her partial recovery he questioned her.

                From the day of this excursion, I have been endeav-
                <lb break="no"/>ouring to gain strength and composure to inform you 
                <lb/>of the interview.

              </p>
              <p>
                It is in vain, my heart sickens at her name.—God of 
                <lb/>mercy! oh pour thy peace upon my soul, that I may 
                <lb/>enter into thy presence in charity with all; bend! oh 
                <lb/>bend, this stubborn heart! which, though it forgives, 
                <lb/>cannot forget.

                I am reduced to almost infantine weakness, and when 
                <lb/>I attempt to write, the letters swim before me, my

                <opener><salute>DEAR SIR,</salute></opener>
              </p>
              <p>
                THE painful task has fallen to my lot, to inform you, 
                <lb/>that the mortal part of your sister, <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>, rests 
                <lb/>on its last bed; but we have strong reason to hope and 
                <lb/>believe, that her soul rejoices in the presence of her 
                <lb/>Creator. She slept in death on the <date when="1794-05-13">13th of this month</date>, 
                <lb/>and was interred on the <date when="1794-05-20">20th ult.</date> yet could I not sum-
                <lb break="no"/>mon sufficient composure to address you until to day, 
                <lb/>on the heart wringing subject. If I who have known 
                <lb/>her but a few years, feel her loss so severely, what 
                <lb/>language can be employed to soften the intelligence to 
                <lb/>a brother who grew up with her from childhood, and 
                <lb/>who knew and justly appreciated her value!
              </p>
              <p>
                Enclosed is a letter, which, as its writing was at-
                <lb break="no"/>tended with peculiarly affecting circumstances, I 
                <lb/>imagine will be extremely valuable to you. <persName>Mrs. Darn-
                  <lb break="no"/>ley</persName> desired me to acquaint you with the circumstance 
                <lb/>she there alluded to. I must previously inform you, 
                <lb/>that during your sister’s long illness, the greatest plea-
                <lb break="no"/>sure she could enjoy was riding round the village, and 
                <lb/>visiting the poor, the sick, and the afflicted; and 
                <lb/>though from various circumstances, I have reason to 
                <lb/>suppose she was not rich; it was astonishing to see by 
                <lb/>how many ways she would assist, comfort and relieve 
                <lb/>the necessitous; practically shewing, that where the 
                <lb/>desire of being useful exists in the heart, the means 
                <lb/>will always be found. And a trifle bestowed in warm 
                <lb/>clothing, ready for wearing, and a few of the comforts 
                <lb/>of life to the sick and aged, such as <seg xml:id="a151" corresp="#n151">sago,</seg><note xml:id="n151" corresp="#a151"><term style="font-style: italic">Sago</term>: a beverage made from the sago palm, imported from the <placeName>East Indies</placeName>; many cookbooks of the time—like <persName>Hannah Glasse’s</persName> <bibl style="font­-style: italic">The Art of Cookery</bibl> or <persName>Richard Dolby’s</persName> <bibl style="font­-style: italic">The Cook’s Dictionary</bibl>—included sago recipes.</note> tea, sugar, 
                <lb/>a little wine, chocolate, or coffee, distributed with dis-
                <lb break="no"/>crimination, will do more essential service, than hun-
                <lb break="no"/>dreds lavished without judgment by the hand of prodi-
                <lb break="no"/>gality. As I frequently had the honour of attending 
                <lb/>her in these excursions, <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> being prevented 
                <lb/>that pleasure by his employment, I was ever solici-
                <lb break="no"/>tous to discover objects that would interest her; as for 
                <lb/>many weeks previous to her dissolution, no other means 
                <lb/>would promote the desired end of her taking air and 
                <lb/>exercise. I now proceed with the narrative the dear 
                <lb/>deceased was unable to finish—continuing from where 
                <lb/>she broke off.
              </p>
              <p>
                I questioned the woman if she knew <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>; 
                <lb/>she hesitated, and then replied, “Yes, I wish I could 
                <lb/>see her.”—From further conversation, I found some-
                <lb break="no"/>thing lay heavy on her mind, I perceived also that she 
                <cb/>
                <lb/>was in want of many comforts and necessaries which 
                <lb/>your sister knew so well how to supply with delicacy, 
                <lb/>that I did not attempt any thing myself until I had her 
                <lb/>better judgment to direct me. There was a middle 
                <lb/>aged woman with her, whose manners, language and 
                <lb/>appearance, indicated that she had not been always the 
                <lb/>child of abject poverty.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the morning when I accompanied <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> 
                <lb/>to the lodging of the invalid, whose name I then un-
                <lb break="no"/>derstood was Manners, her companion was absent. 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> approached the bed, and addressed her in 
                <lb/>those consolatory accents which ever flowed from her 
                <lb/>lips: but the old woman was so agitated, that for some 
                <lb/>time she could not speak, at length she articulated.—
                <lb/>“Forgive—I am punished—vice is its own reward.”—
                <lb/>“Who are you?” said <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName>—but before she 
                <lb/>could receive an answer, the companion entered.—
                <lb/>“Good God!” exclaimed the woman, starting back.—
                <lb/>“<persName>Jesse</persName>—<persName>Jesse Romain</persName>!” said your sister, with quick-
                <lb break="no"/>ness, and catching her breath as though oppressed 
                <lb/>with a sense of suffocation, covered her face with her 
                <lb/>hands, and fell into an hysterical fit of tears.—I now too 
                <lb/>late perceived that I had brought my valued friend into 
                <lb/>a situation too distressing for the weak and irritable 
                <lb/>state of her nerves. I threw up the window, and see-
                <lb break="no"/>ing some drops on the table, poured a little into some 
                <lb/>water, and entreated her to swallow it.—She recovered 
                <lb/>her voice, and turning again to the person in the bed, 
                <lb/>she said, “Is it possible that you can be <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>?” 
                <lb/>I will not pretend to describe the scene that ensued.—
                <lb/>I almost forced <persName>Mrs. Darnley</persName> out of the house, and 
                <lb/>hastened her home, bitterly repenting my officiousness 
                <lb/>in taking her to visit these women.—She retired im-
                <lb break="no"/>mediately to her own apartment, only requesting to 
                <lb/>see me in the evening. When I went, I found her ex-
                <lb break="no"/>tremely low; in a few short, but emphatic sentences, 
                <lb/>she gave me to understand that she had received from 
                <lb/>both these women the highest injuries that one human 
                <lb/>being can receive from another; her peace of mind 
                <lb/>had been destroyed, her domestic quiet broken, her 
                <lb/>character calumniated.—She thus concluded. “I had 
                <lb/>hoped to have died without again beholding those dis-
                <lb break="no"/>graces to womanhood: but this is no time to indulge 
                <lb/>resentment, I have too much need of forgiveness my-
                <lb break="no"/>self to hold enmity with any one. You say they are 
                <lb/>distressed.—What little is in my power, I will <supplied reason="obscured">cheer-
                <lb break="no"/>fully</supplied> do for them, but indeed I cannot see them again.”
                <lb/>—Then after a short pause, she continued.—“I will 
                <lb/>confess I am at a loss to account for their present dis-
                <lb break="no"/>tressed situation. I wish, <persName>Mr. Hayley</persName>, you would see 
                <lb/>them.”
              </p>
              <p>
                I readily promised to visit them, obtain all the in-
                <lb break="no"/>formation in my power, and administer to their necessi-
                <lb break="no"/>ties.—I found <persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName> had been deserted by her 
                <lb/>daughter, who had left <persName>Lord Linden</persName>, and gone to <placeName>Italy</placeName> 
                <lb/>with a French adventurer; her grand daughter <persName>Caroline</persName> 
                <lb/>had fallen from one grade of vice to another, to which she 
                <lb/>had been encited by her wretched mother and grand 
                <lb/>mother, until in the very bloom of life, she fell a vic-
                <lb break="no"/>tim to disease and wretchedness in a common prison. 
                <lb/>Thus the sins of the parent were visited upon the 
                <lb/>child.—<persName>Jesse Romain</persName> had become the companion of 
                <lb/><persName>Mrs. Bellamy</persName>, and finding themselves reduced to the 
                <lb/>very last ebb in fame and finances, they resolved to 
                <lb/>try their fortune in <placeName>England</placeName>. They embarked at <placeName>Wa-
                  <lb break="no"/>terford</placeName>, but a variety of concurring circumstances threw 
                <lb/>them sick and destitute on the coast of <placeName>Wales</placeName>, where 
                <lb/>they fell under my notice. The woman <persName>Bellamy</persName>, seems 
                <lb/>hastening to her final audit; her terrors are great, nor 
                <lb/>can I inspire her with the least hope that penitence 
                <lb/>will obtain the pardon of her Judge.—“I cannot think 
                <lb/>of it now,” she cries, “for I cannot prove my sincerity 
                <lb/>by altering my course of life.”  	*	*	*	*	*	*

            <div type="letter">
              <body>
                <p>
                  <persName>MRS. DARNLEY</persName>, from the day of this unfortunate 
                  <lb/>visit, drooped hourly. Yet she was not confined to her 
                  <lb/>bed, and as she ever was particularly fond of writing, 
                  <lb/>she always had the pens, ink and paper, on a stand by 
                  <lb/>her easy chair; though for above six weeks, she seldom 
                  <lb/>had written more than two or three lines at a time. 
                  <lb/>The day she wrote the last line in the letter I enclose, 
                  <lb/>her husband and myself were sitting at the other end 
                  <lb/>of the room, when we heard her breathe a deep sigh; a 
                  <lb/>deathly paleness overspread her face, the pen fell from 
                  <lb/>her fingers, and before we could get to her, she sunk 
                  <lb/>lifeless back in her chair. We lifted her on the bed, 
                  <lb/>and summoned assistance; in about half an hour, res-
                  <lb break="no"/>piration returned, and lifting her dying eyes with an 
                  <lb/>expression, never to be erased from my memory, she 
                  <lb/>said faintly, “It is the last struggle.”—This was about 
                  <lb/>five in the afternoon; upon the arrival of the physician, 
                  <lb/>he pronounced that she would never again leave her 
                  <lb/>bed, though she might possibly linger three or four 
                  <lb/>days, but in all human probability a much shorter pe-
                  <lb break="no"/>riod would close the scene.—During the night, she had 
                  <lb/>several hours of composed rest. I did not leave the 
                  <lb/>house; my heart was wrung with inexpressible anguish, 
                  <lb/>and <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName> stood in need of comfort and support; 
                  <lb/>indeed, at times, it seemed as if his reason would for-
                  <lb break="no"/>sake him; he execrated himself, execrated the women, 
                  <lb/>whose presence he imagined had hastened the ap-
                  <lb break="no"/>proaching dissolution of his wife.—<persName>Mr. Lewis</persName>, it was 
                  <lb/>a night of distress and misery.—About sun rise, being 
                  <lb/>told that I was in the house, she desired to see me.—
                  <lb/>“My worthy friend,” said she, “God has been very 
                  <lb/>good to me, and has afforded me a short repose to re-
                  <lb break="no"/>cruit my strength, that I may perform all my duties be-
                  <lb break="no"/>fore I go hence. I wish to partake of the solemn rite 
                  <lb/>of the Lord’s supper; will you pray by me and admin-
                  <lb break="no"/>ister it? that I may die in peace with all my fellow 
                  <lb/>creatures, and oh, my friend, pray! pray earnestly, 
                  <lb/>that I may enter into the peace of my Saviour.”—
                  <lb/>While I was preparing for this solemnity, she desired to 
                  <lb/>see her husband and son. When all was prepared, and 
                  <lb/>she supported in the bed by a domestic who was very 
                  <lb/>much attached to her, (as indeed all are who have had 
                  <lb/>an opportunity to investigate her character) she held 
                  <lb/>out one hand to me and one to <persName>Mr. Darnley</persName>, at the 
                  <lb/>same time placing <persName>Charles</persName> between us.—“<persName>George</persName>,” 
                  <lb/>said she to her husband, “whatever disagreements 
                  <cb/>
                  <lb/>may have been between us, I pray you believe I never 
                  <lb/>meant wilfully to give you pain, or offend you. I have 
                  <lb/>had many faults; when I am gone, remember them not 
                  <lb/>against me, but consign them with my memory to ob-
                  <lb break="no"/>livion; and believe me, as I stand on the verge of eter-
                  <lb break="no"/>nity, one thought that tended to your dishonour has 
                  <lb/>never been amongst them.—<persName>Mr. Hayley</persName>, I owe much 
                  <lb/>to your friendship; it has been the sweetener of the last 
                  <lb/>years of my life; it has smoothed my passage to the 
                  <lb/>grave; it will, I hope and trust, be renewed beyond it.—
                  <lb/><persName>Charles</persName>, my good lad, I leave you. May God bless 
                  <lb/>you, may you be virtuous, and in the end be assured 
                  <lb/>you will be happy; be dutiful to your father.—<persName>George</persName>, 
                  <lb/>be a faithful father to this poor boy, he has no moth-
                  <lb break="no"/>er.—<persName>Mr. Hayley</persName>—though the whole world forsake 
                  <lb/>him, be you his friend.—One thing more, tell those 
                  <lb/>unhappy women, <persName>Bellamy</persName> and <persName>Romaine</persName>, my last reli-
                  <lb break="no"/>gious act will include a prayer for their eternal welfare; 
                  <lb/>and if I have hated them, I hope it was their vices, not 
                  <lb/>themselves, towards whom I nourished that senti-
                  <lb break="no"/>ment”—Then folding her hands, and elevating her 
                  <lb/>eyes with the most affecting fervour, she audibly re-
                  <lb break="no"/>peated the Lord’s prayer, and turning her face toward 
                  <lb/>me, begged me to proceed in my office.—I do assure 
                  <lb/>you, dear Sir, it was with the utmost difficulty that I 
                  <lb/>could perform the service; my voice was choked, and 
                  <lb/>I could scarcely restrain the sobs that laboured in my 
                  <lb/>convulsed bosom; a sweet and solemn serenity pervad-
                  <lb break="no"/>ed her voice and countenance as she joined in the 
                  <lb/>responses. When it was over, she embraced us all; 
                  <lb/>the chill of death was on her lips which pressed against 
                  <lb/>my cheek. “It is an awful thing to die,” said she, 
                  <lb/>“to stand in the presence of a God of purity; oh! what 
                  <lb/>have I to plead?—nothing—and only that I know, HE, 
                  <lb/>who said, <seg xml:id="a153" corresp="#n153">“<persName>Lazarus</persName>, come forth,”</seg><note xml:id="n153" corresp="#a153"><term style="font-style: italic">Lazarus, come forth</term>: referring to <bibl>John 11:43</bibl>.</note> and the dead obey-
                  <lb break="no"/>ed his voice can and will purify me from my offences, 
                  <lb/>I should fear greatly.—But he has said, <seg xml:id="a154" corresp="#n154">“I am the 
                    <lb/>resurrection and the life, and whoso believeth on me 
                    <lb/>shall not perish.”</seg><note xml:id="n154" corresp="#a154"><term style="font-style: italic">I am the resurrection</term>: roughly quoting <bibl>John 11:25</bibl>.</note> Her voice faltered, she sunk back, 
                  <lb/>her eyes were fixed upwards, and her ardent spirit 
                  <lb/>took its flight to the regions of immortality.———Af-
                  <lb break="no"/>ter this account of her exit, to offer any thing by way 
                  <lb/>of consolation, would be impertinent and superfluous. 
                  <lb/>I will therefore drop my pen, after having entreated a 
                  <lb/>continuance of your friendship. I am, dear Sir, yours, 
                  <lb/>with esteem,

            THE sincerity of <persName>Sarah’s</persName> dying declaration, that “ev-
            <lb break="no"/>en in thought she had never dishonoured her hus-
            <lb break="no"/>band,” was confirmed by the confession of <persName>Mrs. Bel-
              <lb break="no"/>lamy</persName>. Indeed, it was hardly possible for any one to 
            <lb/>doubt her truth who were acquainted with her, as she 
            <lb/>never seriously averred the thing that was not; profes-
            <lb break="no"/>sed an affection she did not feel, or disguised a disgust 
            <lb/>that she did.—Her husband felt her loss for a few <emph style="font­-style: italic">days</emph>, 
            <lb/>very severely; for a few <emph style="font­-style: italic">weeks</emph> was decently grave; but 
            <lb/>the seductive Romaine tried means to comfort him, and 
            <lb/>he was comforted,—until he <emph style="font­-style: italic">married her</emph>.—Alas, poor 
            <lb/><persName>Darnley</persName>, she then paid him with interest, all he had in-
            <lb break="no"/>flicted on the uncomplaining, unoffending <persName>Sarah</persName>.—From 
            <lb/>this account of our Heroine’s sufferings, let no one say, 
            <lb/>where then is the reward of virtue, if such a woman is 
            <lb/>not happy? but let them reflect on her peaceful, beati-
            <lb break="no"/>fied end, and cry, “Vice, where are thy fascinations? 
            <lb/>will they take out the sting of death?—No.—It is the 
            <lb/>sincere and pious spirit alone that tried in the thrice 
            <lb/>heated furnace of affection, comes out like refined gold, 
            <lb/>bright and pure, fit to be placed in the palace of the 
            <lb/>Most High.”

  In <date when="1813">1813</date>, <persName>Rowson’s</persName> novel was retitled and issued as a book. The 
  <lb/>text was not changed significantly, as noted earlier, but the new title arguably 
  <lb/>modified how readers thought about the work. The <seg xml:id="a155" corresp="#n155">cover page, reproduced 
    <lb/>here,</seg><note xml:id="n155" corresp="#a155"><figDesc>To view the cover page, see page 107 in the PDF available here:
      http://jto.common-place.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/Rowsons-Sincerity-Complete-JTO-format.pdf</figDesc></note> also included two epigraphs. The first read “<quote>Do not marry a fool; he is 
        <lb/>continually doing absurd and disagreeable things, for no other reason but to 
        <lb/>shew he dares do them.</quote>” The citation was taken from <persName>James Gregory’s</persName> <bibl style="font­-style: italic">Father’s Legacy to his Daughters</bibl>, written in <date when="1781">1781</date> but published 
  ,lb/posthumously in <date when="1774">1774</date>. <persName>Gregory’s</persName> work was intended as a private advice 
  <lb/>manual for his daughters, but eventually became a bestselling conduct 
  <lb/>manual, offering advice to women about religious conduct, moral behavior, 
  <lb/>and selection of a suitable husband. So popular was <persName>Gregory’s</persName> <bibl style="font­-style: italic">Legacy</bibl> that 
  <lb/><persName>Mary Wollstonecraft</persName> offered an extended critique of the volume in <bibl style="font­-style: italic">A 
    <lb/>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</bibl> (<date when="1792">1792</date>), wherein she argued that 
  <lb/>the volume deceived women into thinking they needed to subordinate 
  <lb/>themselves in order to be happy. The second epigraph, unattributed, read 
  <lb/>“<quote>Remember that nothing but strict truth can carry you through life with 
    <lb/>honor and credit.</quote>” The source here was <persName>Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth 
      <lb/>Earl of Chesterfield’s</persName> posthumously published <bibl style="font­-style: italic">Letters to His Son on the 
        <lb/>Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman</bibl> (<date when="1774">1774</date>). 
  <lb/>Comprised of thirty years’ worth of letters that <persName>Stanhope</persName> addressed to his son, 
  <lb/>the text became a popular conduct guide in the late eighteenth century, though 
  <lb/>it became controversial for its cool attitude toward religion, its negative views 
  <lb/>of women, and its uncertain morality.
</p>
      <p>
        The novel also included a new preface, which we reproduce below.

        You never read prefaces, you say. Pray

        The present work made its appearance 
        <lb/>about eight years since, in the <bibl><placeName>Boston</placeName> 
          <lb/>Weekly Magazine</bibl>; but it was written 
        <lb/>at snatches of time, and under the pres-
        <lb break="no"/>sure of much care and business incident 
        <lb/>to my profession; consequently was in a 
        <lb/>degree incorrect. It has now gone through 
        <lb/>a revision, and is offered to the public as 
        <lb/>an example of how much the human mind 
        <lb/>can bear, when supported by conscious 
        <lb/>rectitude, and whose every impulse is con-
        <lb break="no"/>formable to the strictest integrity and a 
        <lb/>love of truth. It may be objected that 
        <lb/>the example will lose its effect, as my he-
        <lb break="no"/>roine is not in the end rewarded for her 
        <lb/>exemplary patience, virtue, and forbear-
        <lb break="no"/>ance: But it was because I wished to 
        <lb/>avoid every unnatural appearance, that I 
        <lb/>left <persName>Sarah</persName> to meet her reward in a better 
        <lb/>world. Characters of superlative excel-
        <lb break="no"/>lence, tried in the furnace of affliction, 
        <lb/>and at length crowned by wealth, honor, 
        <pb/>
        <lb/>love, friendship, every sublunary good, 
        <lb/>are to be found abundantly in every nov-
        <lb break="no"/>el, but alas! where shall we find them in 
        <lb/>real life? Such examples therefore, in-
        <lb break="no"/>stead of stimulating the young or inexpe-
        <lb break="no"/>rienced mind to emulate the virtues rep-
        <lb break="no"/>resented, misleads it by fallacious hopes 
        <lb/>and expectations which can never be re-
        <lb break="no"/>alized; disappointed in the anticipated 
        <lb/>temporal felicity, where it is discovered 
        <lb/>that virtue and integrity may be over-
        <lb break="no"/>looked by the thoughtless and unfeeling; 
        <lb/>or left to pine in obscurity by the worldly 
        <lb/>wise, and ostentatiously prudent; it slack-
        <lb break="no"/>ens in its endeavour, and concludes the 
        <lb/>existence of the character portrayed to 
        <lb/>be as chimerical as the happiness repre-
        <lb break="no"/>sented as its reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be inquired, “Do I then deny 
        <lb/>the existence of friendship, generosity, 
        <lb/>compassion, and that first of Christian 
        <lb/>virtues, Charity?” Oh no! I should be 
        <lb/>the most ungrateful of human beings if I 
        <lb/>did; many have been the instances which 
        <lb/>I have witnessed of this reality, which, 
        <lb/>like roses scattered in a wilderness, per-
        <lb break="no"/>fumed and sweetened the journey of life; 
        <lb/>but in that journey I have also encounter-
        <lb break="no"/>ed many a thorn, and many a flint, that 
        <lb/>have lacerated my feelings to the very 
        <lb/>quick.

              <persName>Sarah</persName> is not a faultless monster; she 
              <lb/>comes as near perfection as is the lot of 
              <lb/>humanity; but she was credulous, impet-
              <lb break="no"/>uous, and apt to decide with too much 
              <lb/>precipitation. Yet under all her misfor-
              <lb break="no"/>tunes she is represented as drawing com-
              <lb break="no"/>fort and consolation from a source that is 
              <lb/>never fallacious, can never be exhausted. 
              <lb/>She looks up to her heavenly Father with 
              <lb/>love and confidence, she endeavours to 
              <lb/>make his laws the rule of her actions, 
        <lb/>and trusts in his promises for her reward. 
              <lb/>Who of common reflection but would pre-
              <lb break="no"/>fer the death of <persName>Sarah</persName>, resigned as she 
              <lb/>was, and upheld by faith and hope, to all 
              <lb/>the splendors, wealth and honors that 
              <lb/>were ever heaped upon the heroine in the 
              <lb/>last pages of a novel? Here let the young 
              <lb/>voyagers, just entering on the turbulent 
              <lb/>ocean of life, fix their eyes, and they will 
              <lb/>find a comforter in disappointment, a sup-
              <lb break="no"/>port in the heaviest calamity, a safe and 
              <lb/>sure passport to eternal peace.

        Many of the scenes delineated in the 
        <lb/>following work are drawn from real life; 
        <lb/>some of them have occurred within my own 
        <lb/>knowledge; but it was in another hem-
        <lb break="no"/>isphere, and the characters no longer ex-
        <lb break="no"/>ist. <persName>Darnley</persName> was a profligate; his crime 
        <lb/>became his punishment; for surely no 
        <lb/>life can be pictured so completely wretch-
        <lb break="no"/>ed as where two persons, knowing from 
        <pb/>
        <lb/>experience the turpitude of each other’s 
        <lb/>heart, are obliged to wear out the last 
        <lb/>remnant of existence together, in mutual 
        <lb/>jealousy, hatred and recrimination.

        Beware, ye lovely maidens who are now 
        <lb/>fluttering on the wing of youth and pleas-
        <lb break="no"/>ure, how you select a partner for life. 
        <lb/>Purity of morals and manners in a hus-
        <lb break="no"/>band, is absolutely necessary to the hap-
        <lb break="no"/>piness of a delicate and virtuous woman. 
        <lb/>When once the choice is made and fixed 
        <lb/>beyond revocation, remember patience, 
        <lb/>forbearance, and in many cases perfect 
        <lb/>silence, is the only way to secure domes-
        <lb break="no"/>tic peace. What, in all marriages? asks 
        <lb/>some young friend. Why, in truth, there 
        <lb/>is seldom any so perfectly <seg xml:id="a156" corresp="#n156">felicitous,</seg><note xml:id="n156" corresp="#a156"><term style="font-style: italic">Felicitous</term>: well-chosen or suited to the circumstances.</note> but 
        <lb/>that instances may occur where patience, 
        <lb/>forbearance, and silence, may be practised 
        <lb/>with good effect.
